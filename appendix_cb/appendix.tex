    \captionTitle{\textbf{The proportion of recombination in various proportions of sequence.}}{ 
        Data is shown from multiple human sources.
        Dashed lines represent data from the unrefined maps, while data from the refined maps is shown in green, red and blue.
        For the refined and unrefined maps, females are shown in red, males in blue, and sex-averaged maps in green.
        Data from the Hapmap LD-based map\cite{hapmap2007} is shown with a solid black line.
        This figure is taken from \citet{Bherer2016}.

    \captionTitle{\textbf{Male and female recombination rate around the transcription start site in humans.}}{ 
        The recombination rate (in cM/Mb) is estimated in 1 kb bins around the transcription start sites (TSS). 
        From the autosomes, 15,239 genes are used, and are thinned so that no two genes in this set fall within 5 kb.
        Male rates are shown in shades of blue, while female rates are shown in red shades.
        Panel A represents the entire set of genes.
        In panel B, data from each sex has been split to include or exclude genes that have the PRDM9 13 bp motif within 5 kb of the TSS.
        This figure is taken from \citet{Bherer2016} and was generated by Claude Bh\'{e}rer.
