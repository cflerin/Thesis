  abstract =      {The maintenance of the eukaryotic genome requires
                   precisely coordinated replication of the entire
                   genome each time a cell divides. To achieve this
                   coordination, eukaryotic cells use an ordered series
                   of steps to form several key protein assemblies at
                   origins of replication. Recent studies have
                   identified many of the protein components of these
                   complexes and the time during the cell cycle they
                   assemble at the origin. Interestingly, despite
                   distinct differences in origin structure, the
                   identity and order of assembly of eukaryotic
                   replication factors is highly conserved across all
                   species. This review describes our current
                   understanding of these events and how they are
                   coordinated with cell cycle progression. We focus on
                   bringing together the results from different
                   organisms to provide a coherent model of the events
                   of initiation. We emphasize recent progress in
                   determining the function of the different replication
                   factors once they have been assembled at the origin.},

                   recombination. Specifically, it mediates chromosome
                   synapsis during the lengthy prophase of meiosis I.
                   The SC consists of two parallel lateral elements, one
                   central element, and numerous transverse filaments.
                   Recent genetic studies in mice have provided novel

                   regulates meiosis and into the etiology of diseases

                   structure, the synaptonemal complex (SC) [Fawcett, J

                   Biophys Biochem Cytol 2:215-218, 1956]. SCs consist
                   of two proteinaceous axes, which each support the two
                   sister chromatids of one homolog, and numerous

                   axes. Organisms that assemble SCs perform meiotic
                   recombination in the context of these structures.
                   Although much information has accumulated about the

                   crossing over, several questions remain about the

                   of the TFs. In this review, we focus on possible
                   role(s) of TFs. The interest in TF functions received
                   new impulses from the recent characterization of
                   TF-deficient mutants in a number of species.
                   Intriguingly, the phenotypes of these mutants are
                   very different, and a variety of TF functions appear
                   to be hidden behind a fa{\c{c}}ade of morphological
                   conservation. However, in all TF-deficient mutants a
                   specific class of crossovers that display
                   interference is affected. TFs appear to create
                   suitable preconditions for the formation of these
                   crossovers in most species, but are most likely not
                   directly involved in the interference process itself.
                   Furthermore, TFs are important for full-length
                   homolog alignment.},

                   components of the synaptonemal complex (SCP1 and
                   SCP3) and some proteins known to participate in

                   meiosis remains largely unstudied, and these studies
                   could provide important clues about the mechanics of
                   recombination. This work reports the relative timing
                   and localization of five different meiotic proteins
                   that have previously been implicated in human
                   homologous recombination [RAD51, replication protein
                   A (RPA), MSH4, MLH1 and MLH3]. MSH4 foci appear
                   concurrently with synapsis initiation at zygotene,
                   shortly after the first RAD51 foci are detected. The
                   presence of RPA in MSH4 foci was noted, suggesting
                   that these two proteins may act co-operatively. Both
                   RPA and MSH4 foci reach maximal numbers at the end of
                   zygotene, when synapsis is concluding. From this
                   point, RPA foci all but disappear by the end of
                   pachytene, whereas MSH4 foci decline to a stable
                   number at mid-pachytene, where they localize with
                   MLH1/MLH3 recombination sites. We discuss a possible

                   mammalian species, including humans, but the basis
                   for the male:female differences remains unclear. In
                   the present study, we used cytological methodology to
                   directly compare recombination levels between human
                   males and females, and to examine possible
                   sex-specific differences in upstream events of
                   double-strand break (DSB) formation and synaptic
                   initiation. Specifically, we utilized the DNA
                   mismatch repair protein MLH1 as a marker of
                   recombination events, the RecA homologue RAD51 as a
                   surrogate for DSBs, and the synaptonemal complex
                   proteins SYCP3 and/or SYCP1 to examine synapsis
                   between homologs. Consistent with linkage studies,
                   genome-wide recombination levels were higher in
                   females than in males, and the placement of exchanges
                   varied between the sexes. Subsequent analyses of DSBs
                   and synaptic initiation sites indicated similar
                   male:female differences, providing strong evidence
                   that sex-specific differences in recombination rates
                   are established at or before the formation of meiotic
                   DSBs. We then asked whether these differences might
                   be linked to variation in the organization of the
                   meiotic axis and/or axis-associated DNA and, indeed,
                   we observed striking male:female differences in
                   synaptonemal complex (SC) length and DNA loop size.
                   Taken together, our observations suggest that sex
                   specific differences in recombination in humans may
                   derive from chromatin differences established prior

                   crossing-over. We review the genetic properties of
                   meiotic recombination and previous models of
                   conversion and crossing-over. In these models,
                   recombination is initiated by single-strand nicks,

                   explained by the repair of mismatches present in
                   heteroduplex DNA. We propose a new mechanism for
                   meiotic recombination, in which events are initiated
                   by double-strand breaks that are enlarged to
                   double-strand gaps. Gene conversion can then occur by
                   the repair of a double-strand gap, and postmeiotic
                   segregation can result from heteroduplex DNA formed

                   repair of double-strand gaps is an efficient process

  abstract =      {During meiosis the programmed induction of DNA
                   double-stranded breaks (DSB) leads to crossover (CO)
                   and non-crossover products (NCO). One key role of CO
                   is to connect homologs before metaphase I and thus to
                   ensure the proper reductional segregation. This role
                   implies an accurate regulation of CO frequency with
                   the establishment of at least one CO per chromosome
                   arm. Current major challenges are to understand how
                   CO and NCO formation are regulated and what is the
                   role of NCO. We present here the current knowledge
                   about CO and NCO and their regulation in mammals. CO
                   density varies widely along chromosomes and their
                   distribution is not random as they are subject to
                   positive interference. As documented in the mouse and
                   human, a significant excess of DSB are generated
                   relative to the number of CO. In fact, evidence has
                   been obtained for the formation of NCO products, for
                   regulation of the choice of DSB repair towards CO or
                   NCO and for a CO specific pathway. We discuss the
                   roles of Msh4, Msh5 and Sycp1 which affect DSB repair
                   and probably not only the CO pathway. We suggest
                   that, in mammals, the regulation of NCO differs from
                   that described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

                   efficient crossing-over in a very small region of

                   recombinant DNA techniques, random single-copy DNA
                   probes capable of detecting DNA sequence
                   polymorphisms, when hybridized to restriction digests
                   of an individual's DNA. Each of these probes will
                   define a locus. Loci can be expanded or contracted to
                   include more or less polymorphism by further
                   application of recombinant DNA technology. Suitably
                   polymorphic loci can be tested for linkage
                   relationships in human pedigrees by established
                   methods; and loci can be arranged into linkage groups
                   to form a true genetic map of "DNA marker loci."
                   Pedigrees in which inherited traits are known to be

                   respect to the DNA marker loci, without requiring
                   direct access to a specified gene's DNA. For

                   for probabilities of exclusion and synteny, choice of
                   well-spaced loci for linkage tests, and comparison
                   with centromeric maps based on nondisjunction.
                   Interpolation of new data into a map is possible only
                   when the length is known, including the distances
                   from centromere and telomeres to the nearest markers.
                   Current evidence on physical parameters including the
                   reliable measurements of relative lengths from flow
                   cytometry but only a crude estimate of genome size
                   (3200 megabases). Evidence on genetic parameters
                   includes chiasma counts and linkage maps corrected
                   for failure to sample telomeres, giving an autosomal
                   size of 2809 centimorgans in males and 4782
                   centimorgans in females. Estimates of the physical
                   and sex-specific genetic lengths are presented for
                   each chromosome arm. Any linkage analysis that yields
                   substantially larger estimates raises a suspicion of
                   an inappropriate mapping function or typing errors.},

                   although aided considerably by many existing computer
                   programs, require extensive user-intervention at each
                   of many repetitive steps. This is time consuming,
                   labour intensive and increases the chance of error.
                   We have developed an expert system computer program,
                   MultiMap, which automates this step-by-step
                   procedure. MultiMap is based on a novel map
                   construction algorithm and allows investigator
                   control of marker locus characteristics, such as
                   informativeness, scorability or distance to nearest
                   neighbours. We used MultiMap to construct a human
                   genetic map at an average resolution of 6 cM, using
                   published genotypes at 1266 microsatellite markers,
                   and further extended this map by adding 397 VNTR and

                   CEPH families; they incorporated {\textgreater}8,000

                   genotypes that resulted in tight double recombinants

                   total number of recombination events per gamete,
                   among the eight mothers of the CEPH families, were
                   significantly different, and this variation was not
                   due to maternal age. The female:male ratio of genetic
                   distance varied across individual chromosomes in a
                   remarkably consistent fashion, with peaks at the

                   the euchromatic portion of the human genome was
                   generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing
                   method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was
                   generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality
                   sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome)
                   from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of
                   five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a
                   whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome
                   assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from
                   Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The
                   public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to
                   create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions
                   that had been sequenced, without including biases
                   inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used
                   by the publicly funded group. This brought the
                   effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold,
                   reducing the number and size of gaps in the final
                   assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold
                   coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very
                   similar results that largely agree with independent
                   mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the
                   euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More
                   than 90{\%} of the genome is in scaffold assemblies
                   of 100,000 bp or more, and 25{\%} of the genome is in
                   scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the
                   genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding
                   transcripts for which there was strong corroborating
                   evidence and an additional approximately 12,000
                   computationally derived genes with mouse matches or
                   other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense
                   clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are
                   dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large
                   tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1{\%}
                   of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24{\%} is
                   in introns, with 75{\%} of the genome being
                   intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks,
                   ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are
                   abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex
                   evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis
                   indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated
                   with neuronal function, with tissue-specific
                   developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and
                   immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the
                   consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data
                   provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide
                   polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid
                   genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on
                   average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the
                   level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than
                   1{\%} of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins,
                   but the task of determining which SNPs have
                   functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

                   are largely unknown for most species. In humans,
                   pedigree analysis has documented variation at the
                   chromosomal level, and sperm studies have identified
                   specific hotspots in which crossing-over events
                   cluster. To address whether this picture is
                   representative of the genome as a whole, we have
                   developed and validated a method for estimating
                   recombination rates from patterns of genetic
                   variation. From extensive single-nucleotide
                   polymorphism surveys in European and African
                   populations, we find evidence for extreme local rate
                   variation spanning four orders in magnitude, in which
                   50{\%} of all recombination events take place in less
                   than 10{\%} of the sequence. We demonstrate that
                   recombination hotspots are a ubiquitous feature of
                   the human genome, occurring on average every 200
                   kilobases or less, but recombination occurs
                   preferentially outside genes.},

                   a challenging problem. Experimental techniques can
                   provide accurate estimates at fine scales but are
                   technically challenging and cannot be applied on a
                   genome-wide scale. An alternative source of
                   information comes from patterns of genetic variation.
                   Several statistical methods have been developed to
                   estimate recombination rates from randomly sampled
                   chromosomes. However, most such methods either make
                   poor assumptions about recombination rate variation,
                   or simply assume that there is no rate variation.
                   Since the discovery of recombination hotspots, it is
                   clear that recombination rates can vary over many
                   orders of magnitude at the fine scale. We present a
                   method for the estimation of recombination rates in
                   the presence of recombination hotspots. We
                   demonstrate that the method is able to detect and
                   accurately quantify recombination rate heterogeneity,
                   and is a substantial improvement over a commonly used
                   method. We then use the method to reanalyze genetic
                   variation data from the HLA and MS32 regions of the
                   human genome and demonstrate that the method is able
                   to provide accurate rate estimates and simultaneously
                   detect hotspots.},

                   from four geographically diverse populations and
                   includes 25-35{\%} of common SNP variation in the

                   untyped common variation with an average maximum r2
                   of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We
                   demonstrate that the current generation of commercial
                   genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase
                   II SNPs with an average maximum r2 of up to 0.8 in
                   African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations,
                   and that potential gains in power in association
                   studies can be obtained through imputation. These
                   data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of
                   linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30{\%} of

                   least one region of extended genetic identity arising
                   from recent ancestry and that up to 1{\%} of all
                   common variants are untaggable, primarily because
                   they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that
                   recombination rates vary systematically around genes
                   and between genes of different function. Finally, we
                   demonstrate increased differentiation at

                   samples from two males. The sperm-typing technique
                   employed involves the polymerase chain reaction and
                   allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. Our
                   maximum likelihood recombination fraction estimate of
                   0.16 (95{\%}) confidence interval, 0.13-0.19) falls
                   well within previous estimates based on family
                   studies. With current technology and a sample size of
                   1000 sperm, recombination fractions down to
                   approximately 0.009 can be estimated with statistical
                   reliability; with a sample size of 5000 sperm, this
                   value drops to about 0.004. Reasonable technological
                   improvements could result in the detection of
                   recombination frequencies less than 0.001.},

  abstract =      {Little is known about the nature of recombination
                   hotspots in the human genome and the relationship
                   between crossover activity and patterns of linkage
                   disequilibrium. We have therefore used both haplotype
                   analysis and direct detection of crossovers in sperm
                   to characterize a putative recombination hotspot in
                   the TAP2 gene within the class II region of the MHC.
                   Haplotype diversity provided evidence for a localized
                   hotspot within intron 2 of this gene. Sperm DNA
                   typing using allele-specific PCR primers to
                   selectively amplify recombinant TAP2 molecules
                   revealed a highly localized meiotic crossover hotspot
                   approximately 1.2 kb long, unusually abundant in
                   sequence polymorphisms and flanked by DNA much less
                   active in recombination. Sperm crossover appeared to
                   be fully reciprocal, and almost all crossover
                   products were simple, involving a single exchange
                   between adjacent heterozygous markers. This hotspot
                   appears to be much more active in female than male
                   meiosis. No primary sequence similarities could be
                   found between any of the very few well defined
                   crossover hotspots in the human genome, all of which
                   show recombinationally active domains 1-2 kb long.
                   Direct comparison of recombination frequency and
                   haplotype diversity in TAP2 showed that linkage
                   disequilibrium measures were a poor predictor of
                   crossover frequency in this region, with
                   non-recombining markers sometimes in free association
                   and with examples of pairs of markers spanning the
                   recombination hotspot showing substantial or even
                   absolute linkage disequilibrium.},

                   facilitate association studies in complex disease.
                   The relative influences of meiotic crossover
                   distribution and population history on LD remain
                   unclear, however. In particular, it is uncertain to
                   what extent crossovers are clustered into 'hot spots,
                   that might influence LD patterns. As a first step to
                   investigating the relationship between LD and
                   recombination, we have analyzed a 216-kb segment of
                   the class II region of the major histocompatibility
                   complex (MHC) already characterized for familial
                   crossovers. High-resolution LD analysis shows the
                   existence of extended domains of strong association
                   interrupted by patchwork areas of LD breakdown. Sperm
                   typing shows that these areas correspond precisely to
                   meiotic crossover hot spots. All six hot spots
                   defined share a remarkably similar symmetrical
                   morphology but vary considerably in intensity, and
                   are not obviously associated with any primary DNA
                   sequence determinants of hot-spot activity. These hot
                   spots occur in clusters and together account for
                   almost all crossovers in this region of the MHC.
                   These data show that, within the MHC at least,
                   crossovers are far from randomly distributed at the
                   molecular level and that recombination hot spots can
                   profoundly affect LD patterns.},

                   pressures. We sequenced 99 sperm from an Asian male

                   diversity by yielding new combinations of alleles.
                   Recently, high-resolution recombination maps were
                   inferred from high-density single-nucleotide
                   polymorphism (SNP) data using linkage disequilibrium
                   (LD) patterns that capture historical recombination
                   events. The use of these maps has been demonstrated
                   by the identification of recombination hotspots and
                   associated motifs, and the discovery that the PRDM9
                   gene affects the proportion of recombinations
                   occurring at hotspots. However, these maps provide no
                   information about individual or sex differences.
                   Moreover, locus-specific demographic factors like
                   natural selection can bias LD-based estimates of
                   recombination rate. Existing genetic maps based on
                   family data avoid these shortcomings, but their
                   resolution is limited by relatively few meioses and a
                   low density of markers. Here we used genome-wide SNP
                   data from 15,257 parent-offspring pairs to construct
                   the first recombination maps based on directly
                   observed recombinations with a resolution that is
                   effective down to 10 kilobases (kb). Comparing male
                   and female maps reveals that about 15{\%} of hotspots
                   in one sex are specific to that sex. Although male
                   recombinations result in more shuffling of exons
                   within genes, female recombinations generate more new
                   combinations of nearby genes. We discover novel
                   associations between recombination characteristics of
                   individuals and variants in the PRDM9 gene and we
                   identify new recombination hotspots. Comparisons of

                   Recent linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sperm-typing
                   studies suggest that recombination rates vary
                   tremendously across the human genome, with most
                   events occurring in narrow "hotspots." To examine
                   variation in fine-scale recombination patterns among
                   individuals, we used dense, genome-wide
                   single-nucleotide polymorphism data collected in
                   nuclear families to localize crossovers with high
                   spatial resolution. This analysis revealed that
                   overall recombination hotspot usage is similar in
                   males and females, with individual hotspots often
                   active in both sexes. Across the genome, roughly
                   60{\%} of crossovers occurred in hotspots inferred
                   from LD studies. Notably, however, we found extensive
                   and heritable variation among both males and females
                   in the proportion of crossovers occurring in these

                   of homologous chromosomes as they are passed from
                   parents to children. Finding the genomic locations
                   where these crossovers occur is important for genetic
                   association studies, understanding population genetic
                   variation, and predicting disease-causing structural
                   rearrangements. There have been several reports that
                   recombination hotspot usage differs between human
                   populations. But while fine-scale genetic maps exist
                   for European and African populations, none have been
                   constructed for Asians. RESULTS: Here we present the
                   first Asian genetic map with resolution high enough
                   to reveal hotspot usage. We constructed this map by
                   applying a hidden Markov model to genotype data for
                   over 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers
                   from Korean and Mongolian pedigrees which include 980
                   meioses. We identified 32,922 crossovers with a
                   precision rate of 99{\%}, 97{\%} sensitivity, and a
                   median resolution of 105,949 bp. For direct
                   comparison of genetic maps between ethnic groups, we
                   also constructed a map for CEPH families using
                   identical methods. We found high levels of
                   concordance with known hotspots, with approximately
                   72{\%} of recombination occurring in these regions.
                   We investigated the hypothesized contribution of
                   recombination problems to age-related aneuploidy. Our
                   large sample size allowed us to detect a weak but
                   significant negative effect of maternal age on
                   recombination rate. CONCLUSIONS: We have constructed
                   the first fine-scale Asian genetic map. This fills an
                   important gap in the understanding of recombination
                   pattern variation and will be a valuable resource for
                   future research in population genetics. Our map will
                   improve the accuracy of linkage studies and inform
                   the design of genome-wide association studies in the
                   Asian population.},

                   recombination hotspots at the kilobase scale,
                   analysis of an entire human chromosome, and the use
                   of wavelet techniques to identify correlations acting
                   at different scales. We show that recombination
                   influences genetic diversity only at the level of
                   recombination hotspots. Hotspots are also associated
                   with local increases in GC content and the relative
                   frequency of GC-increasing mutations but have no
                   effect on substitution rates. Broad-scale association
                   between recombination and diversity is explained
                   through covariance of both factors with base
                   composition. To our knowledge, these results are the
                   first evidence of a direct and local influence of
                   recombination hotspots on genetic variation and the
                   fate of individual mutations. However, that hotspots
                   have no influence on substitution rates suggests that
                   they are too ephemeral on an evolutionary time scale
                   to have a strong influence on broader scale patterns
                   of base composition and long-term molecular
                   evolution.},

                   specification is the Prdm9 gene. First, two mouse

                   meiotic recombination and their positions and
                   activities are regulated by yet-unknown controls. The
                   activity of the Psmb9 hotspot on mouse Chromosome 17
                   (Chr 17) varies according to genetic background. It
                   is active in strains carrying a recombinant Chr 17
                   where the proximal third is derived from Mus musculus
                   molossinus. We have identified the genetic locus
                   required for Psmb9 activity, named Dsbc1 for

                   evidence for the regulation in trans mediated by
                   Dsbc1, by showing that it controls the CO activity at
                   the Hlx1 hotspot on Chr 1. We thus propose that Dsbc1
                   encodes for a trans-acting factor involved in the

                   in carrying out the molecular events of the

                   controlling the positioning of recombination events,
                   we compared the locations of crossovers arising in an
                   8-Mb segment of a 100-Mb region of mouse Chromosome 1
                   (Chr 1) when the longer region was heterozygous
                   C57BL/6J (B6) x CAST/EiJ (CAST) and the remainder of
                   the genome was either similarly heterozygous or
                   entirely homozygous B6. The lack of CAST alleles in
                   the remainder of the genome resulted in profound
                   changes in hotspot activity in both females and
                   males. Recombination activity was lost at several
                   hotspots; new, previously undetected hotspots
                   appeared; and still other hotspots remained
                   unaffected, indicating the presence of distant
                   trans-acting gene(s) whose CAST allele(s) activate or
                   suppress the activity of specific hotspots. Testing
                   the activity of three activated hotspots in sperm
                   samples from individual male progeny of two genetic
                   crosses, we identified a single trans-acting
                   regulator of hotspot activity, designated Rcr1, that
                   is located in a 5.30-Mb interval (11.74-17.04 Mb) on
                   Chr 17. Using an Escherichia coli cloning assay to
                   characterize the molecular products of recombination
                   at two of these hotspots, we found that Rcr1 controls
                   the appearance of both crossover and noncrossover
                   gene conversion events, indicating that it likely
                   controls the sites of the double-strand DNA breaks

                   recombination hotspots, probably via binding of its
                   zinc-finger repeat array to a DNA sequence motif
                   associated with hotspots. However, our view of PRDM9
                   regulation, in terms of motifs defined and hotspots
                   studied, has a strong bias toward the PRDM9 A variant
                   particularly common in Europeans. We show that
                   population diversity can reveal a second class of
                   hotspots specifically activated by PRDM9 variants
                   common in Africans but rare in Europeans. These
                   African-enhanced hotspots nevertheless share very
                   similar properties with their counterparts activated
                   by the A variant. The specificity of hotspot
                   activation is such that individuals with differing
                   PRDM9 genotypes, even within the same population, can
                   use substantially if not completely different sets of
                   hotspots. Each African-enhanced hotspot is activated
                   by a distinct spectrum of PRDM9 variants, despite the
                   fact that all are predicted to bind the same sequence
                   motif. This differential activation points to complex
                   interactions between the zinc-finger array and
                   hotspots and identifies features of the array that
                   might be important in controlling hotspot activity.},

                   frequency and distribution of meiotic recombination
                   events within human crossover hotspots. We now
                   describe the detailed analysis of sperm recombination
                   in the NID1 hotspot. Like the neighbouring MS32
                   hotspot, the NID1 hotspot is associated with a
                   minisatellite, suggesting that hotspots predispose
                   DNA to tandem repetition. Unlike MS32, crossover
                   resolution breakpoints in NID1 avoid the
                   minisatellite, producing a cold spot within the
                   hotspot. This avoidance may be related to the
                   palindromic nature of the minisatellite interfering
                   with the generation and/or processing of
                   recombination intermediates. The NID1 hotspot also
                   contains a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) close
                   to the centre, which appears to directly influence
                   the frequency of crossover initiation. Quantitative
                   gene conversion assays show that this SNP affects the
                   frequency of gene conversion and crossover to a very
                   similar extent, providing evidence that conversions
                   and crossovers are triggered by the same
                   recombination initiating events. The
                   recombination-suppressing allele is over-transmitted
                   to recombinant progeny, and provides the most
                   dramatic example to date of recombination-mediated
                   meiotic drive, of a magnitude sufficient to virtually
                   guarantee that the recombination suppressor will
                   eventually replace the more active allele in human
                   populations.},

                   phenotype differs between female and male, and also
                   among individuals of each gender. In this study, we
                   used high-density SNP genotypes of over 2,300
                   individuals and their offspring in two datasets to

                   recombination phenotypes. We found six genetic loci
                   that are associated with recombination phenotypes.
                   Two of these (RNF212 and an inversion on chromosome
                   17q21.31) were previously reported in the Icelandic

                   crossing-over in the pairing and segregation of
                   chromosomes during human meiosis, the rates and
                   placements of events vary markedly among individuals.
                   Characterizing this variation and identifying its
                   determinants are essential steps in our understanding
                   of the human recombination process and its evolution.
                   STUDY DESIGN/RESULTS: Using three large sets of
                   European-American pedigrees, we examined variation in
                   five recombination phenotypes that capture distinct
                   aspects of crossing-over patterns. We found that the
                   mean recombination rate in males and females and the
                   historical hotspot usage are significantly heritable
                   and are uncorrelated with one another. We then
                   conducted a genome-wide association study in order to
                   identify loci that influence them. We replicated
                   associations of RNF212 with the mean rate in males
                   and in females as well as the association of
                   Inversion 17q21.31 with the female mean rate. We also
                   replicated the association of PRDM9 with historical
                   hotspot usage, finding that it explains most of the
                   genetic variance in this phenotype. In addition, we
                   identified a set of new candidate regions for further
                   validation. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that
                   variation at broad and fine scales is largely
                   separable and that, beyond three known loci, there is
                   no evidence for common variation with large effects
                   on recombination phenotypes.},

                   during meiosis, and every pair of chromosomes obtains
                   at least one crossover, even though the majority of
                   recombination sites yield non-crossovers. A putative
                   regulator of crossing-over is RNF212, which is
                   associated with variation in crossover rates in
                   humans. We show that mouse RNF212 is essential for
                   crossing-over, functioning to couple chromosome
                   synapsis to the formation of crossover-specific
                   recombination complexes. Selective localization of
                   RNF212 to a subset of recombination sites is shown to
                   be a key early step in the crossover designation
                   process. RNF212 acts at these sites to stabilize
                   meiosis-specific recombination factors, including the
                   MutS$\gamma$ complex (MSH4-MSH5). We infer that
                   selective stabilization of key recombination proteins
                   is a fundamental feature of meiotic crossover
                   control. Haploinsufficiency indicates that RNF212 is
                   a limiting factor for crossover control and raises
                   the possibility that human alleles may alter the
                   amount or stability of RNF212 and be risk factors for
                   aneuploid conditions.},

                   imputed variants with sequence-level resolution from
                   2,261 whole genome-sequenced individuals into the
                   parents to search for variants influencing
                   recombination rate. We identified 13 variants in 8
                   regions that are associated with genome-wide
                   recombination rate, 8 of which were previously
                   unknown. Three of these variants associate with male
                   recombination rate only, seven variants associate
                   with female recombination rate only and three
                   variants affect both. Two are low-frequency variants
                   with large effects, one of which is estimated to
                   increase the male and female genetic maps by 111 and
                   416 cM, respectively. This variant, located in an
                   intron, would not be found by exome sequencing.},

                   chiasmata normally ensure the proper segregation of
                   homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic
                   division. zhp-3, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog
                   of the budding yeast ZIP3 gene, is required for
                   crossover recombination. We show that ZHP-3 protein
                   localization is highly dynamic. At a key transition
                   point in meiotic prophase, the protein shifts from
                   along the length of the synaptonemal complex (SC) to
                   an asymmetric localization on the SC and eventually
                   becomes restricted to foci that mark crossover
                   recombination events. A zhp-3::gfp transgene
                   partially complements a null mutation and reveals a
                   separation of function; although the fusion protein
                   can promote nearly wild-type levels of recombination,
                   aneuploidy among the progeny is high, indicating
                   defects in meiotic chromosome segregation. The
                   structure of bivalents is perturbed in this mutant,
                   suggesting that the chromosome segregation defect
                   results from an inability to properly remodel
                   chromosomes in response to crossovers. smo-1 mutants
                   exhibit phenotypes similar to zhp-3::gfp mutants at
                   higher temperatures, and smo-1; zhp-3::gfp double
                   mutants exhibit more severe meiotic defects than
                   either single mutant, consistent with a role for SUMO
                   in the process of SC disassembly and bivalent
                   differentiation. We propose that coordination of
                   crossover recombination with SC disassembly and
                   bivalent formation reflects a conserved role of
                   Zip3/ZHP-3 in coupling recombination with SC

                   regulator of meiotic recombination hot spots in

                   that, in humans, can recognize a short sequence motif
                   associated with hot spots, with binding to this motif
                   possibly triggering hot-spot activity via chromatin
                   remodeling. We now report that human genetic
                   variation at the PRDM9 locus has a strong effect on
                   sperm hot-spot activity, even at hot spots lacking
                   the sequence motif. Subtle changes within the zinc

                   appearance of a new hot spot, suggesting that PRDM9
                   is a major global regulator of hot spots in humans.

                   the recent mixture of people of African and European
                   ancestry in the Americas to build a genetic map
                   measuring the probability of crossing over at each
                   position in the genome, based on about 2.1 million
                   crossovers in 30,000 unrelated African Americans. At
                   intervals of more than three megabases it is nearly
                   identical to a map built in Europeans. At finer
                   scales it differs significantly, and we identify
                   about 2,500 recombination hotspots that are active in
                   people of West African ancestry but nearly inactive
                   in Europeans. The probability of a crossover at these
                   hotspots is almost fully controlled by the alleles an
                   individual carries at PRDM9 (P value {\textless}

                   motif that is enriched in these hotspots, and is an
                   excellent match to the predicted binding target of
                   PRDM9 alleles common in West Africans and rare in
                   Europeans. Sites of this motif are predicted to be
                   risk loci for disease-causing genomic rearrangements
                   in individuals carrying these alleles. More

                   gametogenesis is a major event that generates
                   diversity in the eukaryotic genome. We examined
                   genome-wide microsatellite data for 23,066
                   individuals, providing information on recombination
                   events of 14,140 maternal and paternal meioses each,
                   and found a positive correlation between maternal
                   recombination counts of an offspring and maternal
                   age. We postulated that the recombination rate of
                   eggs does not increase with maternal age, but that
                   the apparent increase is the consequence of
                   selection. Specifically, a high recombination count
                   increased the chance of a gamete becoming a live
                   birth, and this effect became more pronounced with
                   advancing maternal age. Further support for this
                   hypothesis came from our observation that mothers
                   with high oocyte recombination rate tend to have more
                   children. Hence, not only do recombinations have a
                   role in evolution by yielding diverse combinations of
                   gene variants for natural selection, but they are

                   families. Overwhelming evidence was found for strong

                   implied by the Kosambi and Carter-Falconer map
                   functions. Five mathematical models of interference
                   were evaluated: the gamma model and four versions of
                   the count-location model. The gamma model fit the

                   probability of the co-inheritance of linked loci as
                   they are transmitted across generations in both
                   experimental and natural populations. However, in the
                   age of whole-genome sequences, physical distances
                   measured in base pairs of DNA provide the standard
                   coordinates for navigating the myriad features of
                   genomes. Although genetic and physical maps are
                   colinear, there are well-characterized and sometimes
                   dramatic heterogeneities in the average frequency of
                   meiotic recombination events that occur along the
                   physical extent of chromosomes. There also are
                   documented differences in the recombination landscape
                   between the two sexes. We have revisited
                   high-resolution genetic map data from a large
                   heterogeneous mouse population and have constructed a
                   revised genetic map of the mouse genome,
                   incorporating 10,195 single nucleotide polymorphisms
                   using a set of 47 families comprising 3546 meioses.
                   The revised map provides a different picture of
                   recombination in the mouse from that reported
                   previously. We have further integrated the genetic
                   and physical maps of the genome and incorporated SSLP
                   markers from other genetic maps into this new
                   framework. We demonstrate that utilization of the
                   revised genetic map improves QTL mapping, partially
                   due to the resolution of previously undetected errors
                   in marker ordering along the chromosome.},

                   domestic dog uniquely suited to complement genetic
                   analyses in humans and mice. A comprehensive genetic
                   linkage map would afford many opportunities in dogs,
                   ranging from the positional cloning of disease genes
                   to the dissection of quantitative differences in
                   size, shape, and behavior. Here we report a canine
                   linkage map with the number of mapped loci expanded
                   to 276 and 10-cM coverage extended to 75-90{\%} of
                   the genome. Most of the 38 canine autosomes are
                   likely represented in the collection of 39 autosomal
                   linkage groups. Eight markers were sufficiently
                   informative to detect linkage at distances of 10-13

                   together, the results suggested a genome size of
                   about 27 M. As in other species, the genetic length
                   varied between sexes, with the female autosomal
                   distance being approximately 1.4-fold greater than
                   that of male meioses. Fifteen markers anchored
                   well-described genes on the map, thereby serving as
                   landmarks for comparative mapping in dogs. We discuss

                   constructed with approximately 3000 microsatellite
                   markers developed from the reference sequence.
                   Familial resources afforded 450 mostly phase-known
                   meioses for map assembly. The genotype data supported
                   a framework map with approximately 1500 loci. An
                   additional approximately 1500 markers served as map
                   validators, contributing modestly to estimates of
                   recombination rate but supporting the framework
                   content. Data from approximately 22,000 SNPs
                   informing on a subset of meioses supported map
                   integrity. The sex-averaged map extended 21 M and
                   revealed marked region- and sex-specific differences
                   in recombination rate. The map will enable empiric
                   coverage estimates and multipoint linkage analysis.
                   Knowledge of the variation in recombination rate will
                   also inform on genomewide patterns of linkage
                   disequilibrium (LD), and thus benefit association,
                   selective sweep, and phylogenetic mapping approaches.
                   The computational and wet-bench strategies can be

                   half a million genotyped animals, we extracted
                   186,927 three-generation families, identified over
                   8.5 million maternal and paternal recombination
                   events, and constructed sex-specific recombination
                   maps for 59,309 autosomal SNPs. The recombination map
                   spans for 25.5 Morgans in males and 23.2 Morgans in
                   females, for a total studied region of 2,516 Mb (986

                   map is 10{\%} longer than the female map and the sex
                   difference is most pronounced in the subtelomeric

                   putative recombination hotspots, with 720 hotspots
                   shared between sexes. These hotspots encompass 3{\%}

                   NEK9 and REC114, were associated with recombination
                   rate in both sexes, whereas three loci, MSH4, SMC3
                   and CEP55, affected recombination rate in females

                   bovine genome, our GWAS of recombination hotspot
                   usage together with linkage analysis identified the
                   PRDM9 paralogue on chromosome 1 to be associated in

                   markers. Eighty-one of these markers correspond to
                   known genes. Linkage groups have been assigned to all
                   18 autosomes plus the X Chromosome (Chr). As 69 of
                   the markers on the linkage map have also been mapped
                   physically (by others), there is significant
                   integration of linkage and physical map data. Six
                   informative markers failed to show linkage to these
                   maps. As in other species, the genetic map of the
                   heterogametic sex (male) was significantly shorter
                   (approximately 16.5 Morgans) than the genetic map of
                   the homogametic sex (female) (approximately 21.5
                   Morgans). The sex-averaged genetic map of the pig was
                   estimated to be approximately 18 Morgans in length.

                   laboratory-bred marsupial resource for basic biologic
                   and biomedical research worldwide. To enhance the
                   research utility of this species, we are building a
                   linkage map, using both anonymous markers and
                   functional gene loci, that will enable the
                   localization of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and
                   provide comparative information regarding the
                   evolution of mammalian and other vertebrate genomes.
                   The current map is composed of 83 loci distributed
                   among eight autosomal linkage groups and the X
                   chromosome. The autosomal linkage groups appear to
                   encompass a very large portion of the genome, yet
                   span a sex-average distance of only 633.0 cM, making
                   this the most compact linkage map known among
                   vertebrates. Most surprising, the male map is much
                   larger than the female map (884.6 cM vs. 443.1 cM), a
                   pattern contrary to that in eutherian mammals and
                   other vertebrates. The finding of genome-wide
                   reduction in female recombination in M. domestica,
                   coupled with recombination data from two other,
                   distantly related marsupial species, suggests that
                   reduced female recombination might be a widespread
                   metatherian attribute. We discuss possible
                   explanations for reduced female recombination in
                   marsupials as a consequence of the metatherian
                   characteristic of determinate paternal X chromosome

                   charr (1.69:1). Comparisons of recombination rates
                   between homologous segments of linkage groups among
                   species indicated that when significant
                   experiment-wise differences were detected (7/24
                   tests), recombination rates were generally higher in
                   the species with a less-derived chromosome structure
                   (6/7 significant comparisons). Greater similarity in
                   linkage group syntenies were observed between
                   Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, suggesting their
                   closer phylogenetic affinities, and most
                   interspecific linkage group comparisons support a
                   model that suggests whole chromosome arm
                   translocations have occurred in the evolution of this
                   group. However, some possible exceptions were
                   detected and these findings are discussed in relation
                   to their influence on segregation distortion
                   patterns. We also report unusual meiotic segregation
                   patterns in a female parent involving the duplicated
                   (homeologous) linkage group pair 12/16 and discuss
                   several models that may account for these patterns.},

                   genotyping 12,945 single nucleotide polymorphisms
                   (SNPs) on three existing mapping populations in
                   chicken: the Wageningen (WU), East Lansing (EL), and
                   Uppsala (UPP) mapping populations. As many as 8599
                   SNPs could be included, bringing the total number of
                   markers in the current consensus linkage map to 9268.
                   The total length of the sex average map is 3228 cM,
                   considerably smaller than previous estimates using
                   the WU and EL populations, reflecting the higher
                   quality of the new map. The current map consists of
                   34 linkage groups and covers at least 29 of the 38
                   autosomes. Sex-specific analysis and comparisons of
                   the maps based on the three individual populations
                   showed prominent heterogeneity in recombination rates
                   between populations, but no significant heterogeneity
                   between sexes. The recombination rates in the F(1)
                   Red Jungle fowl/White Leghorn males and females were
                   significantly lower compared with those in the WU

                   recombination rate in purebred domestic animals under
                   strong artificial selection. The recombination rate
                   varied considerably among chromosomes as well as
                   along individual chromosomes. An analysis of the

                   spots revealed a strong positive correlation between

                   Z-chromosome (one of the sex chromosomes) from an

                   pronounced sex-dimorphism: males had a substantially

                   have been proposed to explain these dimorphisms. Yet
                   no theoretical model has been explored to determine
                   how heterochiasmy--the autosomal dimorphism--could

                   female and male meiosis in most species has been a
                   genetic enigma since the early study of meiosis. Some
                   hypotheses have been put forward to explain this
                   widespread phenomenon and, up to now, only one fact
                   has emerged clearly: In species in which meiosis is
                   achiasmate in one sex, it is the heterogametic one.
                   This pattern, known as the Haldane-Huxley rule, is
                   thought to be a side effect, on autosomes, of the
                   suppression of recombination between the sex
                   chromosomes. However, this rule does not hold for
                   heterochiasmate species (i.e., species in which
                   recombination is present in both sexes but varies
                   quantitatively between sexes) and does not apply to
                   species lacking sex chromosomes, such as
                   hermaphroditic plants. In this paper, we show that in
                   plants, heterochiasmy is due to a male-female
                   difference in gametic selection and is not influenced
                   by the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes.
                   This finding provides strong empirical support in
                   favour of a population genetic explanation for the
                   evolution of heterochiasmy and, more broadly, for the
                   evolution of sex and recombination.},

                   diploid mothers to strengthen selection among haploid
                   sperm/pollen, because this reduces the mutation load
                   inherited by their diploid offspring. If, however,
                   selection acts in opposite directions in haploids and
                   diploids ("ploidally antagonistic selection"),
                   mothers evolve to reduce haploid selection to avoid
                   selectively amplifying alleles harmful to their
                   offspring. Consequently, with maternal control,
                   selection in the haploid phase either is maximized or
                   reaches an intermediate state, depending on the
                   deleterious mutation rate relative to the extent of
                   ploidally antagonistic selection. By contrast,
                   evolution generally leads diploid fathers to mask
                   mutations in their gametes to the maximum extent
                   possible, whenever masking (e.g., through transcript
                   sharing) increases the average fitness of a father's
                   gametes. We discuss the implications of this
                   maternal-paternal conflict over the extent of haploid
                   selection and describe empirical studies needed to
                   refine our understanding of haploid selection among
                   seemingly diploid organisms.},

                   round spermatids. Some transcripts are the product of
                   genes expressed ubiquitously, whereas some are
                   generated from male germ cell-specific gene homologs
                   of somatic cell genes. Others are transcript variants
                   derived from genes with expression regulated in a

                   spermatids also initiates the transcription of

                   factors, distinct promoter elements, and specific

  abstract =      {Meiotic chromosomes in human oocytes are packaged
                   differently than in spermatocytes at the pachytene
                   stage of meiosis I, when crossing-over takes place.
                   Thus the meiosis-specific pairing structure, the
                   synaptonemal complex (SC), is considerably longer in
                   oocytes in comparison to spermatocytes. The aim of
                   the present study was to examine the influence of
                   this length factor on meiotic recombination in male
                   and female human germ cells. The positions of
                   crossovers were identified by the DNA mismatch repair
                   protein MLH1. Spermatocytes have approximately 50
                   crossovers per cell in comparison to more than 70 in
                   oocytes. Analyses of inter-crossover distances (and
                   presumptively crossover interference) along SCs
                   suggested that while there might be inter-individual
                   variation, there was no consistent difference between
                   sexes. Thus the higher rate of recombination in human
                   oocytes is not a consequence of more closely spaced
                   crossovers along the SCs. The rate of recombination
                   per unit length of SC is higher in spermatocytes than
                   oocytes. However, when the so-called obligate chiasma
                   is excluded from the analysis, then the rates of
                   recombination per unit length of SC are essentially
                   identical in the two sexes. Our analyses indicate
                   that the inter-sex difference in recombination is
                   largely a consequence of the difference in meiotic
                   chromosome architecture in the two sexes. We propose
                   that SC length per se, and therefore the size of the
                   physical platform for crossing-over (and not the DNA
                   content) is the principal factor determining the
                   difference in rate of recombination in male and
                   female germ cells. A preliminary investigation of SC
                   loop size by fluorescence in situ hybridization
                   (FISH) indicated loops may be shorter in oocytes than
                   in spermatocytes.},

                   synaptonemal complexes (SCs) of two fertile men.
                   Comparisons of crossover maps for each individual SC
                   between two men with extremely different meiotic
                   crossover frequencies show that a low crossover
                   frequency results in (i) a higher frequency of XY
                   pairs and of small SCs without MLH1 foci and (ii)
                   lower frequency of crossovers in the proximity of
                   centromeres. In both cases, the bivalents which most
                   frequently lacked MLH1 foci were the XY pair and the
                   SC21. Analysis of SC length showed that SC arms can
                   be longer or shorter than the corresponding mitotic
                   one. Moreover, for a given SC, the variation in
                   length found in one arm was independent of the
                   variation observed in the other one (e.g. SC1p arms
                   are longer than SC1q arms). The results confirmed
                   that reduction in the crossover frequency may
                   increase the risk of achiasmate small bivalents and
                   that interindividual differences in crossover
                   frequency could explain the variability in the
                   frequencies of aneuploidy in human sperm. How MLH1
                   foci are positioned within the SC is discussed based
                   on detailed MLH1 foci distributions and interfoci
                   distances. Finally, evidence that the variation of
                   the SC arm length may reflect the abundance of open
                   and of compact chromatin fibers in the arm is shown.},

                   maternal age. Therefore, age-related effects on
                   recombination are of major importance, especially in
                   relation to the mechanisms involved in human
                   trisomies. Here, we examine the relationship between
                   maternal age and recombination rate in humans. We
                   localized crossovers at high resolution by using over
                   600,000 markers genotyped in a panel of 69
                   French-Canadian pedigrees, revealing recombination
                   events in 195 maternal meioses. Overall, we observed
                   the general patterns of variation in fine-scale
                   recombination rates previously reported in humans.
                   However, we make the first observation of a
                   significant decrease in recombination rates with
                   advancing maternal age in humans, likely driven by
                   chromosome-specific effects. The effect appears to be
                   localized in the middle section of chromosomal arms
                   and near subtelomeric regions. We postulate that, for
                   some chromosomes, protection against non-disjunction
                   provided by recombination becomes less efficient with
                   advancing maternal age, which can be partly
                   responsible for the higher rates of aneuploidy in
                   older women. We propose a model that reconciles our
                   findings with reported associations between maternal
                   age and recombination in cases of trisomies.},

                   comprising over 6,000 meioses from nine cohorts. We
                   develop and fit a hierarchical model to allow for

                   estimate that over 10 years, the expected number of

                   become physically connected, and exchange genetic
                   information. Although many aspects of this process
                   have been elucidated in lower organisms, there has
                   been scant information available until now about the
                   process in mammals. Recent advances in genetic
                   analysis, especially in mice and humans, have
                   revealed many genes that play essential roles in
                   meiosis in mammals. These include cell
                   cycle-regulatory proteins that couple the exit from
                   the premeiotic DNA synthesis to the progression
                   through prophase I, the chromosome structural
                   proteins involved in synapsis, and the repair and
                   recombination proteins that process the recombination
                   events. Failure to adequately repair the DNA damage
                   caused by recombination triggers meiotic checkpoints
                   that result in ablation of the germ cells by
                   apoptosis. These analyses have revealed surprising
                   sexual dimorphism in the requirements of different
                   gene products and a much less stringent checkpoint
                   regulation in females. This may provide an
                   explanation for the 10-fold increase in meiotic
                   errors in females compared with males. This review
                   provides a comprehensive analysis of the use of
                   genetic manipulation, particularly in mice, but also
                   of the analysis of mutations in humans, to elucidate
                   the mechanisms that are required for traverse through
                   prophase I.},

  abstract =      {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The relationship between
                   increasing maternal age and trisomy has been
                   recognized for over 50 years and is one of the most
                   important etiological factors associated with any
                   human genetic disorder. Specifically, the risk of
                   trisomy in a clinically recognized pregnancy rises
                   from about 2-3{\%} for women in their twenties to an
                   astounding 30{\%} or more for women in their forties.
                   Thus, as women approach the end of their
                   child-bearing years, errors of chromosome segregation
                   represent the most important impediment to a
                   successful pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the
                   clinical importance of this relationship, we do not
                   understand how age affects the likelihood of
                   producing a normal egg. Errors that affect chromosome
                   segregation could occur at several stages during the
                   development of the oocyte: in the fetal ovary, either
                   during the mitotic proliferation of oogonia or the
                   early stages of meiosis; in the 'dictyate' oocyte,
                   during the 10-50-year period of meiotic arrest; or
                   during the final stages of oocyte growth and
                   maturation, when meiosis resumes and the meiotic
                   divisions take place. Recent evidence from studies of
                   human oocytes and trisomic conceptions and from
                   studies in model organisms implicates errors at each
                   of these stages. SUMMARY: It seems likely that there
                   are multiple causes of human age-related
                   nondisjunction, complicating our efforts to
                   understand - and, ultimately, to provide preventive
                   measures for - errors associated with increasing
                   maternal age.},

                   completion of human meiosis, it remains unclear how
                   tightly the process is regulated and over what scale.
                   To assess the nature and stringency of constraints on
                   human recombination, we examined crossover patterns
                   in transmissions to viable, non-trisomic offspring,
                   using dense genotyping data collected in a large set
                   of pedigrees. Our analysis supports a requirement for
                   one chiasma per chromosome rather than per arm to
                   ensure proper disjunction, with additional chiasmata
                   occurring in proportion to physical length. The
                   requirement is not absolute, however, as chromosome
                   21 seems to be frequently transmitted properly in the
                   absence of a chiasma in females, a finding that
                   raises the possibility of a back-up mechanism aiding
                   in its correct segregation. We also found a set of
                   double crossovers in surprisingly close proximity, as
                   expected from a second pathway that is not subject to
                   crossover interference. These findings point to
                   multiple mechanisms that shape the distribution of
                   crossovers, influencing proper disjunction in

                   life and, according to the Production Line
                   Hypothesis, the oocytes thus generated are released
                   after puberty as mature ova in the same sequence as
                   that of meiotic entry in fetu. This hypothesis in its
                   original and complete form has a subordinate
                   proposition that concerns chiasma (Xma) frequency; it
                   postulates that Xma number would decrease with fetal
                   age. Consequently, univalents would increase, leading
                   to errors of chromosome disjunction at the first
                   meiotic division (MI), and thus to maternal
                   age-dependent numerical chromosome anomalies. By
                   using an in vitro/in vivo approach, we radioactively

                   synthesis as they sequentially entered meiosis, while
                   the fetal ovaries were in culture. At the end of this
                   in vitro phase, pachytene/diplotene (P/D) stages were
                   studied to determine their labelled fraction. The

                   periods equivalent to early and late gestation, and
                   by comparing the observed proportions of labelled
                   MI/MII with those of oocytes labelled at P/D, we
                   concluded that, in the mouse, ova do not mature at
                   random for release, but are formed according to a

                   is increasing maternal age, but the basis of this
                   association remains unknown. Indeed, one of the
                   earliest models of the maternal-age effect - the
                   "production-line model" proposed by Henderson and
                   Edwards in 1968 - remains one of the most-cited
                   explanations. The model has two key components: (1)
                   that the first oocytes to enter meiosis are the first
                   ovulated and (2) that the first to enter meiosis have
                   more recombination events (crossovers) than those
                   that enter meiosis later in fetal life. Studies in
                   rodents have demonstrated that the first oocytes to
                   enter meiosis are indeed the first to be ovulated,
                   but the association between the timing of meiotic
                   entry and recombination levels has not been tested.
                   We recently initiated molecular cytogenetic studies
                   of second-trimester human fetal ovaries, allowing us
                   to directly examine the number and distribution of
                   crossover-associated proteins in prophase-stage
                   oocytes. Our observations on over 8,000 oocytes from
                   191 ovarian samples demonstrate extraordinary
                   variation in recombination within and among
                   individuals but provide no evidence of a difference
                   in recombination levels between oocytes entering
                   meiosis early in fetal life and those entering late
                   in fetal life. Thus, our data provide a direct test
                   of the second tenet of the production-line model and
                   suggest that it does not provide a plausible
                   explanation for the human maternal-age effect,
                   meaning that - 45 years after its introduction - we
                   can finally conclude that the production-line model
                   is not the basis for the maternal-age effect on

                   unstable genomic regions. These are termed genomic
                   disorders, in which the clinical phenotype is a

                   by the presence of region-specific low-copy repeats
                   (LCRs) and result from nonallelic homologous

  abstract =      {One of the most rapidly evolving genes in humans,
                   PRDM9, is a key determinant of the distribution of
                   meiotic recombination events. Mutations in this
                   meiotic-specific gene have previously been associated
                   with male infertility in humans and recent studies
                   suggest that PRDM9 may be involved in pathological
                   genomic rearrangements. In studying genomes from
                   families with children affected by B-cell precursor
                   acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we
                   characterized meiotic recombination patterns within a
                   family with two siblings having hyperdiploid
                   childhood B-ALL and observed unusual localization of
                   maternal recombination events. The mother of the
                   family carries a rare PRDM9 allele, potentially
                   explaining the unusual patterns found. From exomes
                   sequenced in 44 additional parents of children
                   affected with B-ALL, we discovered a substantial and
                   significant excess of rare allelic forms of PRDM9.
                   The rare PRDM9 alleles are transmitted to the
                   affected children in half the cases; nonetheless
                   there remains a significant excess of rare alleles
                   among patients relative to controls. We successfully
                   replicated this latter observation in an independent
                   cohort of 50 children with B-ALL, where we found an
                   excess of rare PRDM9 alleles in aneuploid and infant
                   B-ALL patients. PRDM9 variability in humans is
                   thought to influence genomic instability, and these
                   data support a potential role for PRDM9 variation in
                   risk of acquiring aneuploidies or genomic
                   rearrangements associated with childhood
                   leukemogenesis.},

                   promote accurate chromosome segregation in meiosis
                   and are controlled such that at least one forms per
                   chromosome pair and multiple crossovers are widely
                   spaced. Recombination initiates with an excess number
                   of double-strand breaks made by Spo11 protein. Thus,
                   crossover control involves a decision by which some
                   breaks give crossovers while others follow a
                   predominantly noncrossover pathway(s). To understand
                   this decision, we examined recombination when breaks
                   are reduced in yeast spo11 hypomorphs. We find that
                   crossover levels tend to be maintained at the expense
                   of noncrossovers and that genomic loci differ in
                   expression of this "crossover homeostasis." These
                   findings define a previously unsuspected
                   manifestation of crossover control, i.e., that the
                   crossover/noncrossover ratio can change to maintain
                   crossovers. Our results distinguish between existing
                   models of crossover control and support the
                   hypothesis that an obligate crossover is a
                   genetically programmed event tied to crossover

                   their spacing is more even than would be expected if
                   they were placed randomly along the chromosomes.
                   Concomitantly with crossover formation, synaptonemal
                   complexes (SCs) appear between homologs: each
                   chromosome forms an axial structure, the axial
                   element (AE); the AEs of homologs align, and numerous
                   transverse filaments connect the AEs to form an SC.
                   Both the AE and the SC have been implicated in the

                   less frequent than expected on the assumption that
                   exchanges occur at random with respect to each other.
                   This "interference," which can be almost total for
                   nearby intervals, diminishes as the intervals in
                   which the double crossovers are scored are moved
                   farther apart. Most models for interference have
                   assumed, at least implicitly, that the intensity of
                   interference depends inversely on the physical
                   distance separating the intervals. However, several
                   observations suggest that interference depends on
                   genetic distance (Morgans) rather than physical
                   distance (base pairs or micrometers). Accordingly, we
                   devise a model in which interference is related
                   directly to genetic distance. Its central feature is
                   that recombinational intermediates (C's) have two
                   fates--they can be resolved with crossing over (Cx)
                   or without (Co). We suppose that C's are distributed
                   at random with respect to each other (no
                   interference); interference results from constraints
                   on the resolution of C's. The basic constraint is
                   that each pair of neighboring Cx's must have between
                   them a certain number of Co's. The required number of
                   intervening Co's for a given organism or chromosome
                   is estimated from the fraction of gene conversions
                   that are unaccompanied by crossover of flanking
                   markers. The predictions of the model are compared
                   with data from Drosophila and Neurospora.},

                   essential to crossing-over also facilitate the

                   organisms--including budding yeast, humans,
                   zebrafish, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis--regulate the

                   interference; they are more evenly spaced along the
                   chromosomes than would be expected if they were
                   placed randomly. The protein complexes involved in
                   recombination can be visualized as immunofluorescent
                   foci. We have analyzed the distribution of such foci
                   along meiotic prophase chromosomes of the mouse to
                   find out when interference is imposed and whether
                   interference manifests itself at a constant level
                   during meiosis. We observed strong interference among
                   MLH1 foci, which mark CO positions in pachytene.
                   Additionally, we detected substantial interference
                   well before this point, in late zygotene, among MSH4
                   foci, and similarly, among replication protein A
                   (RPA) foci. MSH4 foci and RPA foci both mark
                   interhomolog recombinational interactions, most of
                   which do not yield COs in the mouse. Furthermore,
                   this zygotene interference did not depend on SYCP1,
                   which is a transverse filament protein of mouse
                   synaptonemal complexes. Interference is thus not
                   specific to COs but may occur in other situations in
                   which the spatial distribution of events has to be
                   controlled. Differences between the distributions of
                   MSH4/RPA foci and MLH1 foci along synaptonemal
                   complexes might suggest that CO interference occurs
                   in two successive steps.},

                   organisms, recombination forms crossovers between
                   homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes and
                   thereby promotes proper chromosome segregation at the
                   first meiotic division. The number and distribution
                   of crossovers are tightly controlled, but the factors
                   that contribute to this control are poorly understood
                   in most organisms, including mammals. Here we provide
                   evidence that the ATM kinase or protein is essential
                   for proper crossover formation in mouse
                   spermatocytes. ATM deficiency causes multiple
                   phenotypes in humans and mice, including gonadal
                   atrophy. Mouse Atm-/- spermatocytes undergo apoptosis
                   at mid-prophase of meiosis I, but Atm(-/-) meiotic
                   phenotypes are partially rescued by Spo11
                   heterozygosity, such that ATM-deficient spermatocytes
                   progress to meiotic metaphase I. Strikingly,
                   Spo11+/-Atm-/- spermatocytes are defective in forming
                   the obligate crossover on the sex chromosomes, even
                   though the XY pair is usually incorporated in a sex
                   body and is transcriptionally inactivated as in
                   normal spermatocytes. The XY crossover defect
                   correlates with the appearance of lagging chromosomes
                   at metaphase I, which may trigger the extensive
                   metaphase apoptosis that is observed in these cells.
                   In addition, control of the number and distribution
                   of crossovers on autosomes appears to be defective in
                   the absence of ATM because there is an increase in
                   the total number of MLH1 foci, which mark the sites
                   of eventual crossover formation, and because
                   interference between MLH1 foci is perturbed. The axes
                   of autosomes exhibit structural defects that
                   correlate with the positions of ongoing
                   recombination. Together, these findings indicate that
                   ATM plays a role in both crossover control and
                   chromosome axis integrity and further suggests that
                   ATM is important for coordinating these features of
                   meiotic chromosome dynamics.},

                   directly studied by immunolocalization of MLH1
                   protein. In total, 7,848 synaptonemal complexes from
                   436 spermatocytes were analyzed, and 13,969
                   recombination sites were mapped. Individual
                   chromosomes for 113 of the 436 cells (representing
                   2,034 synaptonemal complexes) were identified by
                   immunostaining and fluorescence in situ hybridization
                   (FISH). The average total length of autosomal
                   synaptonemal complexes per cell was 190.3 µm, with
                   32.0 recombination sites (crossovers), on average,
                   per cell. The number of crossovers and the lengths of
                   the autosomal synaptonemal complexes showed
                   significant intra- (i.e. between cells) and

                   recombination sites within each chromosomal category
                   were similar: crossovers in metacentric and
                   submetacentric chromosomes were concentrated in the
                   telomeric regions of the p- and q-arms, whereas two
                   hotspots were located near the centromere and in the
                   telomeric region of acrocentrics. Lack of MLH1 foci
                   was mainly observed in the smaller chromosomes,
                   particularly chromosome 18 (SSC18) and the sex
                   chromosomes. All autosomes displayed positive
                   interference, with a large variability between the
                   chromosomes.},

                   characterized by spectacular chromosomal variation,
                   both autosomal variation of the Robertsonian type and
                   an XX/XY(1)Y(2) system of sex determination. It is an
                   important mammalian model of chromosomal and genome
                   evolution as it is one of the few species with a
                   complete genome sequence. Here we generate a
                   high-precision cytological recombination map for the
                   species, the third such map produced in mammals,
                   following those for humans and house mice. We
                   prepared synaptonemal complex (SC) spreads of meiotic
                   chromosomes from 638 spermatocytes of 22 males of
                   nine different Robertsonian karyotypes, identifying
                   each autosome arm by differential DAPI staining.
                   Altogether we mapped 13,983 recombination sites along
                   7095 individual autosomes, using immunolocalization
                   of MLH1, a mismatch repair protein marking
                   recombination sites. We estimated the total
                   recombination length of the shrew genome as 1145 cM.
                   The majority of bivalents showed a high recombination
                   frequency near the telomeres and a low frequency near
                   the centromeres. The distances between MLH1 foci were
                   consistent with crossover interference both within
                   chromosome arms and across the centromere in
                   metacentric bivalents. The pattern of recombination
                   along a chromosome arm was a function of its length,
                   interference, and centromere and telomere effects.
                   The specific DNA sequence must also be important
                   because chromosome arms of the same length differed
                   substantially in their recombination pattern. These
                   features of recombination show great similarity with
                   humans and mice and suggest generality among mammals.
                   However, contrary to a widespread perception, the
                   metacentric bivalent tu usually lacked an MLH1 focus
                   on one of its chromosome arms, arguing against a
                   minimum requirement of one chiasma per chromosome arm
                   for correct segregation. With regard to autosomal
                   chromosomal variation, the chromosomes showing
                   Robertsonian polymorphism display MLH1 foci that
                   become increasingly distal when comparing acrocentric
                   homozygotes, heterozygotes, and metacentric
                   homozygotes. Within the sex trivalent XY(1)Y(2), the
                   autosomal part of the complex behaves similarly to
                   other autosomes.},

                   chromosomes during meiosis. COs exhibit interference,
                   which leads to widely spaced COs along chromosomes.
                   Strong positive CO interference has been found in
                   humans. However, little is known about the extent of
                   human CO interference. In this study, variations in
                   CO interference over the entire human genome and
                   among individuals were analyzed by immunofluorescence
                   combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization of
                   testicular biopsies from 10 control men. These
                   methods allow for direct identification of the
                   frequency and location of COs in specific chromosomes
                   of pachytene cells. The strength of CO interference
                   was estimated by fitting the frequency distribution
                   of inter-CO distances to the gamma model. Positive
                   interference among CO on chromosomes was observed in
                   these men, and the strength of inter-arm interference
                   was significantly stronger than that for intra-arm
                   CO. In addition, interference was observed to act
                   across the centromere. Significant inter-individual
                   and inter-chromosomal variations in the levels of
                   interference were found, with smaller chromosomes
                   exhibiting stronger interference. Discontinuous
                   chromosome regions (gaps) and unsynapsed chromosome
                   regions (splits) in chromosome 9 had both cis and
                   trans effects on CO interference levels. This is the
                   first report that the interference level varies
                   significantly across the whole genome and that, at
                   least in the human male, anomalies in chromosome
                   synapsis play an important role in altering CO

                   strand during meiosis can be caused by either
                   chromatid interference, crossover interference or
                   both. Although crossover interference has been
                   consistently observed in almost all organisms since
                   the time of the first linkage studies, chromatid
                   interference has not been as thoroughly discussed in
                   the literature, and the evidence provided for it is
                   inconsistent. In this paper with virtually no
                   restrictions on the nature of crossover interference,
                   we describe the constraints that follow from the
                   assumption of no chromatid interference for single
                   spore data. These constraints are necessary
                   consequences of the assumption of no chromatid
                   interference, but their satisfaction is not
                   sufficient to guarantee no chromatid interference.
                   Models can be constructed in which chromatid
                   interference clearly exists but is not detectable
                   with single spore data. We then extend our analysis
                   to cover tetrad data, which permits more powerful
                   tests of no chromatid interference. We note that the
                   traditional test of no chromatid interference based
                   on tetrad data does not make full use of the
                   information provided by the data, and we offer a
                   statistical procedure for testing the no chromatid

                   data from 10 Western chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes

                   recombination rates tend to be conserved, but with
                   exceptions, particularly in regions of chromosomal
                   rearrangements and around the site of ancestral
                   fusion in human chromosome 2. At fine scales,
                   chimpanzee recombination is dominated by hotspots,
                   which show no overlap with those of humans even
                   though rates are similarly elevated around CpG
                   islands and decreased within genes. The
                   hotspot-specifying protein PRDM9 shows extensive

                   developmental programme of gametogenesis.
                   Recombination in mammals has been recently linked to
                   the activity of a histone H3 methyltransferase, PR
                   domain containing 9 (PRDM9), the product of the only
                   known speciation-associated gene in mammals. PRDM9 is
                   thought to determine the preferred recombination
                   sites--recombination hotspots--through
                   sequence-specific binding of its highly polymorphic
                   multi-Zn-finger domain. Nevertheless, Prdm9 knockout
                   mice are proficient at initiating recombination. Here
                   we map and analyse the genome-wide distribution of
                   recombination initiation sites in Prdm9 knockout mice
                   and in two mouse strains with different Prdm9 alleles
                   and their F(1) hybrid. We show that PRDM9 determines
                   the positions of practically all hotspots in the
                   mouse genome, with the exception of the
                   pseudo-autosomal region (PAR)--the only area of the
                   genome that undergoes recombination in 100{\%} of
                   cells. Surprisingly, hotspots are still observed in
                   Prdm9 knockout mice, and as in wild type, these
                   hotspots are found at H3 lysine 4 (H3K4)
                   trimethylation marks. However, in the absence of
                   PRDM9, most recombination is initiated at promoters
                   and at other sites of PRDM9-independent H3K4
                   trimethylation. Such sites are rarely targeted in
                   wild-type mice, indicating an unexpected role of the
                   PRDM9 protein in sequestering the recombination
                   machinery away from gene-promoter regions and other
                   functional genomic elements.},

  abstract =      {Meiotic recombination predominantly occurs at
                   discrete genomic loci called recombination hotspots,
                   but the features defining these areas are still
                   largely unknown (reviewed in refs 1-5). To allow a
                   comprehensive analysis of hotspot-associated DNA and
                   chromatin characteristics, we developed a direct
                   molecular approach for mapping meiotic DNA
                   double-strand breaks that initiate recombination.
                   Here we present the genome-wide distribution of
                   recombination initiation sites in the mouse genome.
                   Hotspot centres are mapped with approximately
                   200-nucleotide precision, which allows analysis of
                   the fine structural details of the preferred
                   recombination sites. We determine that hotspots share
                   a centrally distributed consensus motif, possess a
                   nucleotide skew that changes polarity at the centres
                   of hotspots and have an intrinsic preference to be
                   occupied by a nucleosome. Furthermore, we find that
                   the vast majority of recombination initiation sites
                   in mouse males are associated with testis-specific
                   trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 that is
                   distinct from histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation
                   marks associated with transcription. The
                   recombination map presented here has been derived
                   from a homogeneous mouse population with a defined
                   genetic background and therefore lends itself to
                   extensive future experimental exploration. We note
                   that the mapping technique developed here does not
                   depend on the availability of genetic markers and
                   hence can be easily adapted to other species with
                   complex genomes. Our findings uncover several
                   fundamental features of mammalian recombination
                   hotspots and underline the power of the new
                   recombination map for future studies of genetic
                   recombination, genome stability and evolution.},

                   the development of a unique genetic resource
                   population. The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a
                   multiparental recombinant inbred panel derived from
                   eight laboratory mouse inbred strains. Breeding of
                   the CC lines was initiated at multiple international
                   sites using mice from The Jackson Laboratory.
                   Currently, this innovative project is breeding
                   independent CC lines at the University of North
                   Carolina (UNC), at Tel Aviv University (TAU), and at
                   Geniad in Western Australia (GND). These institutions
                   aim to make publicly available the completed CC lines
                   and their genotypes and sequence information. We
                   genotyped, and report here, results from 458 extant
                   lines from UNC, TAU, and GND using a custom
                   genotyping array with 7500 SNPs designed to be
                   maximally informative in the CC and used a novel
                   algorithm to infer inherited haplotypes directly from
                   hybridization intensity patterns. We identified lines
                   with breeding errors and cousin lines generated by
                   splitting incipient lines into two or more cousin
                   lines at early generations of inbreeding. We then
                   characterized the genome architecture of 350
                   genetically independent CC lines. Results showed that
                   founder haplotypes are inherited at the expected
                   frequency, although we also consistently observed
                   highly significant transmission ratio distortion at
                   specific loci across all three populations. On
                   chromosome 2, there is significant overrepresentation
                   of WSB/EiJ alleles, and on chromosome X, there is a
                   large deficit of CC lines with CAST/EiJ alleles.
                   Linkage disequilibrium decays as expected and we saw
                   no evidence of gametic disequilibrium in the CC
                   population as a whole or in random subsets of the
                   population. Gametic equilibrium in the CC population
                   is in marked contrast to the gametic disequilibrium
                   present in a large panel of classical inbred strains.
                   Finally, we discuss access to the CC population and
                   to the associated raw data describing the genetic
                   structure of individual lines. Integration of rich
                   phenotypic and genomic data over time and across a
                   wide variety of fields will be vital to delivering on
                   one of the key attributes of the CC, a common genetic
                   reference platform for identifying causative variants

                   architecture of recombination as a basic biological
                   process has become amenable to investigation in
                   mammalian model organisms. Here we take advantage of
                   high-density genotyping and the unique pedigree
                   structure of the incipient Collaborative Cross to
                   investigate the roles of sex and genetic background
                   in mammalian recombination. Our results confirm the
                   observation that map length is longer when measured
                   through female meiosis than through male meiosis, but
                   we find that this difference is modified by genotype
                   at loci on both the X chromosome and the autosomes.
                   In addition, we report a striking concentration of
                   crossovers in the distal ends of autosomes in male
                   meiosis that is absent in female meiosis. The
                   presence of this pattern in both single- and
                   double-recombinant chromosomes, combined with the
                   absence of a corresponding asymmetry in the
                   distribution of double-strand breaks, indicates a
                   regulated sequence of events specific to male meiosis
                   that is anchored by chromosome ends. This pattern is
                   consistent with the timing of chromosome pairing and
                   evolutionary constraints on male recombination.
                   Finally, we identify large regions of reduced
                   crossover frequency that together encompass 5{\%} of
                   the genome. Many of these "cold regions" are enriched
                   for segmental duplications, suggesting an inverse
                   local correlation between recombination rate and
                   mutation rate for large copy number variants.},

                   distinguishes Prdm9 alleles that cause hybrid
                   sterility from those that do not. We find that
                   concerted evolution and positive selection have
                   rapidly altered the number and sequence of Prdm9 zinc
                   fingers across 13 rodent genomes. The patterns of
                   positive selection in Prdm9 zinc fingers imply that
                   rapid evolution has acted on the interface between
                   the Prdm9 protein and the DNA sequences to which it
                   binds. Similar patterns are apparent for Prdm9 zinc
                   fingers for diverse metazoans, including primates.
                   Indeed, allelic variation at the DNA-binding
                   positions of human PRDM9 zinc fingers show
                   significant association with decreased risk of
                   infertility. Prdm9 thus plays a role in determining
                   male sterility both between species (mouse) and
                   within species (human). The recurrent episodes of
                   positive selection acting on Prdm9 suggest that the
                   DNA sequences to which it binds must also be evolving
                   rapidly. Our findings do not identify the nature of
                   the underlying DNA sequences, but argue against the
                   proposed role of Prdm9 as an essential transcription
                   factor in mouse meiosis. We propose a hypothetical
                   model in which incompatibilities between
                   Prdm9-binding specificity and satellite DNAs provide
                   the molecular basis for Prdm9-mediated hybrid
                   sterility. We suggest that Prdm9 should be
                   investigated as a candidate gene in other instances
                   of hybrid sterility in metazoans.},

                   double-strand breaks during meiosis, a contributor to
                   speciation processes, and the most rapidly evolving
                   gene in human, and other animal, genomes. Prdm9 genes
                   often exhibit substantial variation in their numbers
                   of encoded zinc fingers (ZFs), not only between
                   closely related species but also among individuals of
                   a species. The near-identity of these ZF sequences
                   appears to render them very unstable in copy number.
                   The rare sequence differences, however, cluster
                   within ZF sites that determine the DNA-binding
                   specificity of PRDM9, and these substitutions are
                   frequently positively selected. Here, possible
                   drivers of the rapid evolution of Prdm9 are

                   typing studies point to the existence of
                   recombination hotspots. These are short regions (1-2
                   kb) in which recombination rates are 10-1,000 times

                   determined to what degree recombination rates are
                   conserved among closely related species by estimating

                   genomic regions are only weakly conserved. Therefore,

  abstract =      {Recent work indicates that allelic incompatibility in
                   the mouse PRDM9 (Meisetz) gene can cause hybrid male
                   sterility, contributing to genetic isolation and
                   potentially speciation. The only phenotype of mouse
                   PRDM9 knockouts is a meiosis I block that causes
                   sterility in both sexes. The PRDM9 gene encodes a
                   protein with histone H3(K4) trimethyltransferase
                   activity, a KRAB domain, and a DNA-binding domain
                   consisting of multiple tandem C2H2 zinc finger (ZF)
                   domains. We have analyzed human coding polymorphism
                   and interspecies evolutionary changes in the PRDM9
                   gene. The ZF domains of PRDM9 are evolving very
                   rapidly, with compelling evidence of positive
                   selection in primates. Positively selected amino
                   acids are predominantly those known to make
                   nucleotide specific contacts in C2H2 zinc fingers.
                   These results suggest that PRDM9 is subject to
                   recurrent selection to change DNA-binding
                   specificity. The human PRDM9 protein is highly
                   polymorphic in its ZF domains and nearly all
                   polymorphisms affect the same nucleotide contact
                   residues that are subject to positive selection. ZF
                   domain nucleotide sequences are strongly homogenized
                   within species, indicating that interfinger
                   recombination contributes to their evolution. PRDM9
                   has previously been assumed to be a transcription
                   factor required to induce meiosis specific genes, a
                   role that is inconsistent with its molecular
                   evolution. We suggest instead that PRDM9 is involved
                   in some aspect of centromere segregation conflict and
                   that rapidly evolving centromeric DNA drives changes
                   in PRDM9 DNA-binding domains.},

                   information and because existing breeds show great
                   phenotypic diversity for morphological, physiological
                   and behavioural traits. We use sequence comparison
                   with the primate and rodent lineages to shed light on
                   the structure and evolution of genomes and genes.
                   Notably, the majority of the most highly conserved
                   non-coding sequences in mammalian genomes are
                   clustered near a small subset of genes with important
                   roles in development. Analysis of SNPs reveals
                   long-range haplotypes across the entire dog genome,
                   and defines the nature of genetic diversity within
                   and across breeds. The current SNP map now makes it
                   possible for genome-wide association studies to
                   identify genes responsible for diseases and traits,

                   for the correct segregation of chromosomes during
                   meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms. In humans,
                   80{\%} of crossovers are estimated to occur at
                   specific areas of the genome called recombination
                   hotspots. Recently, a protein called PRDM9 was
                   identified as a major player in determining the
                   location of genome-wide meiotic recombination
                   hotspots in humans and mice. The origin of this
                   protein seems to be ancient in evolutionary time, as
                   reflected by its fairly conserved structure in
                   lineages that diverged over 700 million years ago.
                   Despite its important role, there are many animal
                   groups in which Prdm9 is absent (e.g. birds,
                   reptiles, amphibians, diptera) and it has been
                   suggested to have disruptive mutations and thus to be
                   a pseudogene in dogs. Because of the dog's history
                   through domestication and artificial selection, we
                   wanted to confirm the presence of a disrupted Prdm9
                   gene in dogs and determine whether this was exclusive
                   of this species or whether it also occurred in its
                   wild ancestor, the wolf, and in a close relative, the
                   coyote. We sequenced the region in the dog genome
                   that aligned to the last exon of the human Prdm9,
                   containing the entire zinc finger domain, in 4 dogs,
                   17 wolves and 2 coyotes. Our results show that the
                   three canid species possess mutations that likely
                   make this gene non functional. Because these
                   mutations are shared across the three species, they
                   must have appeared prior to the split of the wolf and
                   the coyote, millions of years ago, and are not
                   related to domestication. In addition, our results
                   suggest that in these three canid species
                   recombination does not occur at hotspots or hotspot
                   location is controlled through a mechanism yet to be
                   determined.},

                   as the gene responsible for recombination hotspot
                   localization has provided considerable insight into
                   the mechanisms by which recombination is initiated in
                   mammals. However, uniquely amongst mammals, canids
                   appear to lack a functional version of PRDM9 and may
                   therefore provide a model for understanding
                   recombination that occurs in the absence of PRDM9,
                   and thus how PRDM9 functions to shape the
                   recombination landscape. We have constructed a
                   fine-scale genetic map from patterns of linkage
                   disequilibrium assessed using high-throughput
                   sequence data from 51 free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus
                   familiaris. While broad-scale properties of
                   recombination appear similar to other mammalian
                   species, our fine-scale estimates indicate that
                   canine highly elevated recombination rates are
                   observed in the vicinity of CpG rich regions
                   including gene promoter regions, but show little

                   recombination events cluster in discrete genomic
                   locations known as hotspots. In humans, a zinc-finger
                   protein, PRDM9, is believed to initiate recombination
                   in {\textgreater}40{\%} of hotspots by binding to a
                   specific DNA sequence motif. However, the PRDM9
                   coding sequence is disrupted in the dog genome
                   assembly, raising questions regarding the nature and
                   control of recombination in dogs. By analyzing the
                   sequences of PRDM9 orthologs in a number of dog
                   breeds and several carnivores, we show here that this
                   gene was inactivated early in canid evolution. We
                   next use patterns of linkage disequilibrium using
                   more than 170,000 SNP markers typed in almost 500
                   dogs to estimate the recombination rates in the dog
                   genome using a coalescent-based approach. Broad-scale
                   recombination rates show good correspondence with an
                   existing linkage-based map. Significant variation in
                   recombination rate is observed on the fine scale, and
                   we are able to detect over 4000 recombination
                   hotspots with high confidence. In contrast to human
                   hotspots, 40{\%} of canine hotspots are characterized
                   by a distinct peak in GC content. A comparative
                   genomic analysis indicates that these peaks are
                   present also as weaker peaks in the panda, suggesting
                   that the hotspots have been continually reinforced by
                   accelerated and strongly GC biased nucleotide
                   substitutions, consistent with the long-term action
                   of biased gene conversion on the dog lineage. These
                   results are consistent with the loss of PRDM9 in
                   canids, resulting in a greater evolutionary stability
                   of recombination hotspots. The genetic determinants
                   of recombination hotspots in the dog genome may thus
                   reflect a fundamental process of relevance to diverse
                   animal species.},

                   paper reviews both in vivo and in vitro specificities
                   of canine oocytes. Final follicular growth in the
                   bitch is characterised by an early appearance of LH
                   binding sites in the granulosa, a high proportion of
                   polyovular follicles and a preovulatory
                   luteinisation, starting at the time of the LH surge.
                   Through follicular fluid, preovulatory oocytes are
                   thus exposed to high levels of progesterone, as high
                   as 1000-fold plasma concentrations. The composition
                   of the follicular fluid is affected by the size of
                   the female. The more specific aspect of oocyte
                   biology in the bitch is ovulation: oocytes are
                   expelled immature, at the Prophase I stage. Ovulatory
                   follicles are 6-8 mm in diameter, releasing oocytes
                   from 110 µm, with dark cytoplasm. Resumption of
                   meiosis occurs from 48 h postovulation, MII stages
                   appearing 48-54 h after ovulation. The mechanisms
                   controlling such a late meiotic resumption are still
                   unknown. Granulosa cells seem to play a central role
                   as in other mammalian species, but not with cAMP as
                   the principal mediator. The importance of a transient
                   reactivation of oocyte transcription a few hours
                   before meiotic resumption is to be explored. These
                   specific features may contribute to the low
                   efficiency of IVM. Only 10-20{\%} oocytes reach the
                   metaphase stage and suffer from a poor cytoplasmic
                   maturation. Moreover, in vitro culture of canine
                   oocytes is associated with a high proportion of
                   degeneration. To date, IVM of the oocytes is the main
                   limiting factor for the development of assisted
                   reproductive techniques in the canine. A better
                   knowledge of the basic physiology of folliculogenesis
                   and the molecular mechanisms controlling oocyte
                   meiosis resumption in this species may allow us to

                   recombination initiation--either evolve rapidly
                   toward extinction or are conserved, especially if

                   initiation maps from widely divergent Saccharomyces
                   species. We find that hotspots frequently overlap
                   with promoters in the species tested, and
                   consequently, hotspot positions are well conserved.
                   Remarkably, the relative strength of individual
                   hotspots is also highly conserved, as are
                   larger-scale features of the distribution of
                   recombination initiation. This stability, not
                   predicted by prior models, suggests that the
                   particular shape of the yeast recombination landscape
                   is adaptive and helps in understanding evolutionary
                   dynamics of recombination in other species.},

                   vertebrate species, including birds. To study the

                   species lacking the gene that encodes PRDM9, we

                   enriched near functional genomic elements. Unlike in

                   over tens of millions of years. These observations

                   (DTC) genetic testing to evaluate ancestry and
                   wellness. Massive-scale testing of thousands of
                   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is not error
                   free, and such errors could translate into
                   misclassification of risk and produce a false sense
                   of security or unnecessary anxiety in an individual.
                   We evaluated 3 DTC services and a genomics service
                   that are based on DNA microarray or solution
                   genotyping with hydrolysis probes (TaqMan(R)
                   analysis) and compared the test results obtained for
                   the same individual. METHODSWe evaluated the results
                   from 3 DTC services (23andMe, deCODEme, Navigenics)
                   and a genomics-analysis service (Expression
                   Analysis). RESULTSThe concordance rates between the
                   services for SNP data were {\textgreater}99.6{\%};
                   however, there were some marked differences in the
                   relative disease risks assigned by the DTC services
                   (e.g., for rheumatoid arthritis, the range of
                   relative risk was 0.9-1.85). A possible reason for
                   this difference is that different SNPs were used to
                   calculate risk for the same disease. The reference
                   population also had an influence on the relative
                   disease risk. CONCLUSIONSOur study revealed excellent
                   concordance between the results of SNP analyses
                   obtained from different companies with different
                   platforms, but we noted a disparity in the data for
                   risk, owing to both differences in the SNPs used in
                   the calculation and the reference population used.
                   The larger issues of the utility of the information
                   and the need for risk data that match the user's
                   ethnicity remain, however.},

                   NCO events in humans. Using SNP array data from 98
                   meioses, we identified 103 sites affected by NCO, of

                   with double strand break (DSB) hotspots indicates
                   that most of the events are likely of meiotic origin.

                   crossover hot spots in the major histocompatibility
                   complex (MHC) and one in the sex chromosomal
                   pseudoautosomal pairing region PAR1 (ref. 9). All
                   three hot spots are active in gene conversion and
                   crossover. Conversion tracts are short and define a
                   steep bidirectional gradient centered at the peak of
                   crossover activity, consistent with crossovers and
                   conversions being produced by the same

                   occurring at a single site, and seem preferentially
                   to yield conversions rather than crossovers.
                   Crossover breakpoints are more broadly diffused than
                   conversion breakpoints, suggesting either differences
                   between conversion and crossover processing after
                   initiation or the existence of a quality control
                   checkpoint at which short interactions between

                   COs are often associated with gene conversion at the
                   exchange site where genetic information is
                   unidirectionally transferred from one chromosome to
                   the other. COs and independent assortment of
                   homologous chromosomes contribute significantly to
                   the promotion of genomic diversity. What has not been
                   appreciated is the contribution of another product of
                   meiotic recombination, noncrossovers (NCOs), which
                   result in gene conversion without exchange of
                   flanking markers. Here, we review our comprehensive
                   analysis of recombination at a highly polymorphic
                   mouse hotspot. We found that NCOs make up ∼90{\%}

                   transmission distortion, a deviation from Mendelian
                   inheritance in the population. While NCO gene
                   conversion tracts are shorter, and thus have a more
                   punctate effect, their higher frequency translates
                   into an approximately two-fold greater contribution

                   distinct ancestry has a wide range of applications
                   from disease mapping to learning about history. Most
                   methods require the use of unlinked markers; but,
                   using all markers from genome-wide scanning arrays,
                   it should in principle be possible to infer the
                   ancestry of even very small segments with exquisite
                   accuracy. We describe a method, HAPMIX, which employs
                   an explicit population genetic model to perform such
                   local ancestry inference based on fine-scale
                   variation data. We show that HAPMIX outperforms other
                   methods, and we explore its utility for inferring
                   ancestry, learning about ancestral populations, and
                   inferring dates of admixture. We validate the method
                   empirically by applying it to populations that have
                   experienced recent and ancient admixture: 935 African
                   Americans from the United States and 29 Mozabites
                   from North Africa. HAPMIX will be of particular
                   utility for mapping disease genes in recently admixed
                   populations, as its accurate estimates of local
                   ancestry permit admixture and case-control
                   association signals to be combined, enabling more
                   powerful tests of association than with either signal
                   alone.},

                   rate at which it occurs is difficult because of the
                   short lengths of DNA involved. We have developed a
                   new statistical approach to estimating gene
                   conversion rates from genetic variation, by extending
                   an existing model for haplotype data in the presence
                   of crossover events. We show, by simulation, that
                   when the rate of gene conversion events is at least
                   comparable to the rate of crossover events, the
                   method provides a powerful approach to the detection
                   of gene conversion and estimation of its rate.
                   Application of the method to data from the telomeric
                   X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster, in which
                   crossover activity is suppressed, indicates that gene
                   conversion occurs approximately 400 times more often
                   than crossover events. We also extend the method to
                   estimating variable crossover and gene conversion
                   rates and estimate the rate of gene conversion to be
                   approximately 1.5 times higher than the crossover
                   rate in a region of human chromosome 1 with known

                   many analyses of fine-scale molecular-genetics data.
                   Haplotypes can be obtained, at considerable cost,
                   experimentally or (partially) through genotyping of
                   additional family members. Alternatively, a

                   method, applicable to genotype data at linked loci
                   from a population sample, that improves substantially
                   on current algorithms; often, error rates are reduced

                   between genotyped individuals, either by design or by
                   chance. Haplotype estimation in such cohorts is a
                   central step in many downstream analyses. Using
                   genotypes from six cohorts from isolated populations
                   and two cohorts from non-isolated populations, we
                   have investigated the performance of different
                   phasing methods designed for nominally 'unrelated'
                   individuals. We find that SHAPEIT2 produces much
                   lower switch error rates in all cohorts compared to
                   other methods, including those designed specifically
                   for isolated populations. In particular, when large
                   amounts of IBD sharing is present, SHAPEIT2 infers
                   close to perfect haplotypes. Based on these results
                   we have developed a general strategy for phasing
                   cohorts with any level of implicit or explicit
                   relatedness between individuals. First SHAPEIT2 is
                   run ignoring all explicit family information. We then
                   apply a novel HMM method (duoHMM) to combine the
                   SHAPEIT2 haplotypes with any family information to
                   infer the inheritance pattern of each meiosis at all
                   sites across each chromosome. This allows the
                   correction of switch errors, detection of
                   recombination events and genotyping errors. We show
                   that the method detects numbers of recombination
                   events that align very well with expectations based
                   on genetic maps, and that it infers far fewer
                   spurious recombination events than Merlin. The method
                   can also detect genotyping errors and infer
                   recombination events in otherwise uninformative
                   families, such as trios and duos. The detected
                   recombination events can be used in association scans
                   for recombination phenotypes. The method provides a
                   simple and unified approach to haplotype estimation,
                   that will be of interest to researchers in the fields
                   of human, animal and plant genetics.},
