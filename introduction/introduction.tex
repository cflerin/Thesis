\section{Meiotic recombination overview}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Meiosis occurs in all sexually reproducing organisms, and is essential to the generation of gametes.
Recombination plays a key role in this process, facilitating the pairing and alignment of chromosomes, while the exchange of genetic material has important implications in inheritance, natural selection, and evolution.

        Crossover (shown at right) is the large-scale, reciprocal exchange of genetic material between two chromosomes around the break point.
        Gene conversion (or non-crossover, shown at left) is the one-way transfer of small amounts of DNA from one chromosome to the other during the repair of the break.

\subsection{The biology of meiotic recombination}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Prior to meiosis, a diploid cell contains pairs of homologous chromosomes, one of the pair inherited from the father, the other from the mother.
This diploid DNA is replicated just prior to the cell entering the meiotic cycle, in premeiotic S-phase\cite{Bell2002} to generate exact copies of each pair of chromosomes, referred to as sister chromatids.
Meiosis consists of two stages; recombination occurs in the first, meiosis I, while meiosis II sees sister chromatids separate into their respective daughter cells.
Meiosis I is the most complex and lengthy stage, with chromosome pairing, synapsis, and recombination all occurring in succession within prophase I, which is  divided into several sub-stages.

In leptotene (derived from Greek meaning ``thin threads''), changes in chromatin cause the newly replicated chromosomes to form thin individual strands.
Here, the synaptonemal complex (SC), a protein structure that will bind the sister chromatids and their homologues into a tetrad begins to assemble.
The SC consists of a scaffold of proteins that first forms with axial elements that associate with the already paired sister chromatids, solidifying their association.

In the zygotene phase (``paired threads''), pairing between the unraveled DNA begins to occur at regions of homology in a process known as synapsis.
Homologous chromosomes connect to to the SC by transverse filaments, drawing them into the SC structure in a progressive zipper-like mechanism, completing synapsis\cite{Yang2009}.
DNA DSBs occur at this stage (*).

By the pachytene stage (``thick threads''), synapsis, and the SC assembly are fully complete, and the pairs of homologous chromosomes bound within the SC are referred to as a tetrad or bivalent.
Recombination occurs here, mediated by the structure of the SC.
A subset of the DSBs are processed as crossovers, at locations called chiasmata.
The remaining DSBs are repaired through a different pathway, as non-crossovers (gene conversions).

In the diplotene stage (``two threads''), the SC is disassembled, allowing the tetrad to relax slightly.
The homologous chromosomes are still held together at chiasmata locations.

In the final substage of prophase I, diakinesis (``moving through''), the chromosomes condense into visible threads, while the cellular machinery begins to prepare for cell division.
The remaining step of meiosis I are metaphase I, and anaphase I.
Chiasmata, holding the chromosomes together as crossover points are cut, allowing the homologous chromosomes to segregate to their respective cellular poles.

Meiosis II is procedurally similar to mitosis, with different results.
Here, the separation of sister chromatids occurs, producing four haploid gametes.




The recombination process is begun by programmed double strand breaks (DSBs) in the DNA, catalyzed by the protein SPO11, which has a similar function to DNA topoisomerases\cite{DeMassy2013}.
There are two isoforms of \textit{Spo11} in humans, and mice, and a recent study in mice suggests that they may have differing functions, with \textit{Spo11$\beta$} being expressed earlier in meiosis, coinciding with most DSBs occurring on the autosomes.
Male mice with only \textit{Spo11$\beta$} had meiotic defects, with the majority of spermatocytes failing to recombine in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR).
Following this, \textit{Spo11$\alpha$} was found to be expressed later in meiosis, and coincided with DSBs located within the sex chromosomes, including the PAR\cite{Kauppi2011,DeMassy2013}.
This evidence indicates that the initiation of DSBs is a complex, multi-stage process, with autosomal DNA process earlier than DNA from the allosome.




\paragraph{Non-disjunction and the role of recombination.}
In humans, an estimated 30\% of fertilized eggs have aneuploid chromosomes\cite{Hassold2001}, and evidence suggests that meiotic errors are responsible in many cases.
Non-disjunction, the abnormal segregation of chromosomes, can occur at either of the two cell divisions in meiosis.
Meiosis II non-disjunction typically results from a failure of the sister chromatids to separate.
Meiosis I non-disjunction is thought to involve recombination, either in a failure to resolve chiasmata, or a lack of chiasmata entirely.

A reduced recombination rate has been observed in human genetic maps generated from meiosis I aneuploidies (15, 16, 18, 21, XXX, XXY)\cite{Hassold2001,Lynn2004}.
This indicates that recombination rate must remain above a certain level to prevent non-disjunction.
This is supported by the finding that many trisomies involve achiasmate chromosomes, in which recombination is absent in that crhomsome(*).

This supports the idea that chiasmata, which serve to tether homolgous chromosomes together after the dissolution of the SC, and through the first, provide a crucial tension that serves to inhibit non-disjunction.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Timing of meiotic events}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%Human:
The fundamental steps of meiosis are the same in males and females, but the timing of these events, both prior and during, differs significantly between the sexes\cite{Lynn2004}, and even between species.
In humans, male meiosis begins at puberty and continues in a cycle that lasts throughout the lifespan.
As male meiosis is continually occurring, the precursor cells undergo a minimum of 30 divisions prior to entering meiosis, and this number continues to rise with age.
A 15 year old male is estimated to be 35 germ-cell divisions, with this number rising to 380 at age 30, and 840 by age 50\cite{Crow2000a}.

Females have 22 cell divisions prior to meiotic entry, and one during, for a total of 23 divisions\cite{Crow2000a}, and this number is fixed for all oocytes.
In females, meiosis begins prenatally, and oocytes progress through the diplotene stage of prophase I before undergoing an arrest period\cite{Hassold2001,Crow2000a}.
This arrest is called the dictyotene stage, or dictyate arrest, and meiosis is frozen at the point the chromosomes have fully synapsed and chiasmata have formed\ref{fig:introTiming}.
This arrest period ends only upon ovulation, and thus meiosis can be potentially very lengthy, taking one to five decades to complete.
Additionally, while each male meiosis produces four haploid sperm products, female meiosis yields one haploid oocyte contain the majority of the cytoplasm, the remaining meiosis I and II division products produce polar bodies, which contain DNA but typically apoptose\cite{Schmerler2011}.

Male progenitor cells undergo potentially many more mitotic divisions prior meiotic entry.
As the number of mitioc proliferations increases in males, so does the number of mutations accumulated through DNA replication errors.
A recent study using a chimpanzee pedigree estimated that the number of mutations rises linearly with the father's age, with approximately three additional mutations accumulating per year\cite{Venn2014}.
This contributes to a paternal age effect, with mutations accumulating on the male germ line with increasing age.

Dog meiosis differs from that of humans in some key respects.
Meiosis in female dogs begins later, starting in the neonatal period\cite{Freixa1987}.
The meiotic arrest occurs at the same dictyotene stage in both species, but is shorter in dogs, given the later onset of meiosis in dogs as well as a reduced lifespan.
In addition, while meiosis exits the arrest period prior to ovulation in humans, dogs ovulate immature, primary oocytes, which only mature to fertility 48-60 hours after ovulation\cite{Tsutsui1989,Chastant-Maillard2011}.

\subsection{Methods for studying recombination}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Recombination can be observed in a number of ways.
Genome-wide methods have the primary goal of creating a genetic map of the frequency of recombination as a function of physical distance across each chromosome.
In contrast, several other methods are limited in scope, and reveal information about specific loci.
With each method, the detection of recombination is made difficult by the fact that crossovers are rare -- only 20-50 are expected to occur in each meiosis.

% brief introduction to these before describing in detail in "description of approach"
\subsubsection{Pedigree analysis}

Tracing the inheritance of markers from one generation to the next within a family pedigree provided the first genome-wide measurement of recombination across the human genome, prior to the completion of the Human Genome Project.
Early studies used restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) probes to identify specific loci within the genome, and determine if they are linked.
An study described the use of RFLPs to generate a linkage map of recombination in the human genome\cite{Botstein1980}.
Further linkage studies increased the marker density across the genome by using microsatellite, short tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRPs) and other approaches to capturing genetic variation\cite{Morton1991,Matise1994,Dib1996}.
The Marshfield map, generated in 1998 by \citet{Broman1998}, was an important step in characterizing recombination on a genome-wide basis.

With the completion of the Human Genome Project and the publication of the draft sequence of the human genome\cite{Venter2001,Lander2001}, human genetic variation has become increasingly characterized, and a number of technologies have sprung up to make genome-wide ascertainment of variation routine.
Currently, microarray technology provides a well-balanced approach for determining genome-wide coverage of genetic variation.
These arrays target a pre-selected panel of hundreds of thousands to millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across every chromosome for a reasonable cost.
While whole-genome sequencing technology allows the discovery of a higher density of markers across the genome, its use is not typically worth the higher cost.
A higher variant coverage will help to narrow the region of uncertainty surrounding a particular crossover, but it will most likely not assist in the detection of additional crossovers in a single meiosis.

Regardless of the method used for obtaining markers, the principle of detecting recombination in a pedigree remains.
Crossovers can be identified by tracing the allele transmissions from parent to child.
Figure \ref{fig:introPedfig} provides a simple visual example, showing a family quartet.
The father in this pedigree has two informative SNPs producing haplotypes 1-1 and 0-0, while the mother is homozygous at both sites.
The male child has a 1-0 haplotype, and therefore must have inherited a recombinant haplotype from his mother.
We can identify here a crossover event and localize that event to an interval flanked by two informative genetic variants.
This region of uncertainty can vary in size and depends on the spacing and genotypes of polymorphic variants within the genome.

\subsubsection{Linkage disequilibrium approach}

Another powerful method is to use population genetic data to study recombination by inference.
These data can be gathered by genotyping samples of genetic data from unrelated individuals on a microarray or by whole-genome sequencing.

The inference of recombination in such a dataset relies on the quantification of levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) within the samples, a measurement of linkage between loci.
For example, when alleles at one locus are inherited completely independently of alleles at another locus they are considered to be in linkage equilibrium.
However many alleles exhibit a non-random association, and individuals of the same species tend to share haplotype segments that reflect a shared evolutionary history.
When two alleles on an ancestral haplotype are inherited together they are considered linked, and are not independent of each other.
These alleles exhibit evidence of linkage disequilibrium, a deviation from the assumption of random assortment of alleles.

LD is measured in a pairwise fashion, considering allele frequencies at each pair of markers in the genome.

\subsubsection{Molecular assays}

A number of molecular assays have been developed for studying recombination.
Most, however are limited to small regions of the genome, and are more effective in males.

\paragraph{Sperm cell assays.}

Sperm typing is one method of identifying both gene conversion and crossover events.

Sperm typing was first used in 1989 to study crossing over in humans\cite{Cui1989}, and uses
allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify recombination events at a given locus.
In this method, DNA is extracted from multiple haploid sperm cells from a single donor and subject to PCR.
A common reverse primer is used in conjunction with two different allele-specific forward primers, which correspond to polymorphic site in the diploid genome, and are designed to produce different amplicon sizes depending on the matching nucleotide.
Analysis of the PCR products from many sperm cells can reveal the phase of the donor individual, and the recombinant status of each sperm cell.
% \cite{Jeffreys1998,Jeffreys2000,Jeffreys2004}. % first, second(TAP2), review

Sperm typing has been used to produce high-quality data from a number of loci throughout the genome.
One of the first major findings to come out of sperm typing was the characterization of a recombination hotspot in the human major histocompatability complex (MHC), first within one gene, \textit{TAP2}\cite{Jeffreys2000}, then expanded to cover a wider 216 kb region of the MHC\cite{Jeffreys2001}.
All six hotspots found within the region of the MHC were found to be tightly correlated to regions in which LD broke down, providing molecular evidence that recombination hotpots have severe effects on LD patterns.

\citet{Lu2012}
\citet{Wang2012}


\paragraph{Single oocytes.}
Recent studies have provided much needed insight into recombination in single oocytes through novel methods.
\citet{Hou2013} conducted an analysis in human oocytes, providing at the same time a potential new method for applying next generation sequencing methods to the screening for various genetic disorders with in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques.
Here, the researchers extracted and fertilized a total of 70 oocytes from 8 Asian female donors, collecting the first and second polar bodies, as well as the male and female pronucleus from the fertilized egg.
This complete collection of data from female oogenesis and fertilization enabled haplotype phasing and crossover calls
Most intriguingly, this enabled the generation of personal genetic maps for each donor, allowing the researchers to address the question of how recombination varies on an individual basis.
This data allows the observation of all four members of the tetrad bundle, both sister chromatids and their homologues, something usually missed by inferential studies of recombination.

This data allows valuable data to be inferred regarding both crossover interference, affecting the spacing between pairs of crossovers, and chromatid interference, affecting which chromatid is involved in crossing over within the tetrad.
Comparing to previously published sperm data\cite{Lu2012}, \citet{Hou2013} look at crossover spacing as a function of both physical distance (in bp), and synaptonemal complex length (\SI{}{\micro\metre}), concluding that the strength of interference is equivalent in males and females when considering the synaptonemal complex length, which is longer in females, reflecting their higher recombination rate.
%an observation that conflicts with a number of other studies\cite{Broman2000,Housworth2003,Fledel-Alon2009}.
Somewhat puzzling was the omission of genetic distance (in centimorgans) in this analysis, a factor that controls for the 1.6 fold higher recombination rate in females over males.
A reanalysis of this data using genetic distance is presented in this thesis in Chapter X.

By identifying which chromatid is involved in each crossover \citet{Hou2013} found evidence for weak and negative chromatid interference.
This means that once an initial crossover is established between two chromatids (e.g.\ labeled 1 and 2), a second crossover is more likely to form using at least one of these first chromatids (1 and 2), and less likely to form using neither (between 3 and 4).
Positive chromatid interference corresponds to an decrease in the probability of a second crossover involving the same chromatids as the first, that is, the first crossover ``interferes'' or prevents the placement of the second on the same chromatids.





\subsubsection{Recombination initiation maps}
Additional methods have been developed to identify double strand breaks within a individual cells undergoing meiotic recombination.
\citet{Pratto2014} utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with sequencing to identify DSBs associatated with the strand-exchange protein DMC1 to generate DSB maps in four unrelated human males.
This method identifies the majority of DSBs within the meiotic cell, only a fraction of which will be resolved as crossovers that could be identified via genotyping methods, the remainder ending up as non-crossover gene conversions.
The researchers found the DSB cluster into hotspots, of which 51\% overlapped with the LD crossover hotspots\cite{hapmap2007}, and 80\% of DSB hotspots overlapped regions with elevated recombination rate.
In addition, the DSB locations were largely tied to the specific PRDM9 allele for each particular individual.
PRDM9$_\text{A}$ and PRDM$_\text{B}$ alleles appear to specify similar DSB hotspots, while PRDM9$_\text{C}$ has a separate specificity.
PRDM9 heterozygosity also affects hotspot strength.

\subsection{Current ``gold standard'' maps (Hapmap2 LD map, deCODE pedigree map).}

\subsubsection{Marshfield map}
The Marshfield map, generated by \citet{Broman1998} in 1998, was the first genetic map of the human genome at a resolution high enough to make inferences on the recombination properties in humans, using $>$8000 short tandem repeat polymorphsims (STRPs) in 188 meioses.
Here, estimates of the genome wide map lengths, inferences on individual variation, and sex differences in recombination were highlighted.
The ratio of female to male autosomal map length was estimated at 1.56, indicating that the recombination rate in females is substantially higher than males.
This ratio has proved stable over a number of studies in the intervening years (summarized in Table \ref{tab:introHeterochiasmy}).
Analysis of this this ratio as a function of chromosome position revealed that male recombination tends to be highest in the telomeres, while females had a higher ratio towards the centromeres.
This study provided valuable insight into sex dimporphism in recombination

\subsubsection{deCODE maps}
Another major stride in pedigree-based genetic maps came from deCODE genetics, an Icelandic pharmaceutical company that used their database of genealogical and genetic data on many Icelandic families to infer recombination, producing many high quality studies.
The first was in 2002, where 146 families, comprising 1257 meioses, were genotyped using 5136 microsatellite markers\cite{Kong2002}.
This data, in conjunction with the draft sequence of the human genome\cite{Venter2001,Lander2001} was used to improve the marker order and their placement within the reference sequence.
The genetic map generated from this study confirmed much found by \citet{Broman1998} in terms of sex dimorphism in recombination, and further characterized fine scale variation between the chromosomes.
One particular finding was that of recombination ``jungles,'' regions of high crossover rate that clustered towards the telomeres.
In addition, recombination rate was found to correlate with GC content, CpG motif occurrance, and tracts of poly(A)/poly(T), together explaining $\sim$37\% of variation.

In 2010, using genome wide SNP data on x meioses, deCODE genetics published an updated sex-specific recombination map\cite{Kong2010}.
Instead of a typical pedigree-based recombination study, \citet{Kong2010} leverage the high degree of relatedness within the Icelandic population to infer phase and parent-of-origin in 20,217 individuals typed on microarrays assaying $>$289,000 autosomal SNPs.
Here, phase is determined for parent-child pairs by taking into account haplotype blocks that are shared with other individuals within the population to determine the parent-of-origin for a particular block.
Crossovers are called when a segment of a child's haplotype is inferred to move between maternal and paternal origin.
This enables recombination be called in 15,257 parent-offspring pairs.
%%%
One effect of this parent-child phasing approach is that inference of recombination events near the telomeres is difficult, and \citet{Kong2010} omit the most distal 5 Mb for each chromosome.
The omission of the telomeric regions, where male recombination is higher, contributes to the inflation of the female:male map length ratio seen in Table \ref{tab:introHeterochiasmy}) at 1.78 in this study, however much more likely to be closer to the consensus ratio of around 1.56.
Since its release in 2010 the deCODE genetic map has proven quite valuable as a high quality sex-specific map of recombination in the human genome.

Kong2010 (place elsewhere):
Lower rec. rate within genic regions (and this difference is greater for females).
Recombination tends to be depressed within geneic regions overall compared to intergenic, with recombination high just upstream of the TSS and downstream of the TSE, and falling off after a few hundred kb\cite{Kong2010,Coop2008}.
Additionally, while females have a lower rates within genic regions, males have higher rate within exonic regions.

\subsection{Maternal age effect.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Age effects on reproduction have been tied with an increased incidence of aneuploidy in humans\cite{Hassold2001,*}.

Several studies have shown evidence for an increase in the number of crossover events with maternal age, suggesting a protective mechanism against aneiploidy.
%%%
With the aim of investigating age effects in recombination, a study in 2004 using the deCODE genetics dataset with 23,066 meioses, using a reduced set of 1000 microsatellite markers\cite{Kong2004}.
Genotyping was not done for every individual, with some families having only one parent genotyped, and recombination events were therefore imputed.
The main finding from this study is that the number of crossovers observed in females appears to increase with age, with an additional 0.082 events per year ($\pm$0.012), corresponding to a 4\% increase over 25 years.
This effect was seen to increase within families, such that a child born later in the mother's life has a higher number of maternal crossover than their siblings born earlier.
\citet{Coop2008} analyzed recombination in 728 meioses from Hutterites, and found that mothers 35 year or older have an extra 3.1 crossover events compared to mothers under 25 years old.
This effect corresponds with an extra 0.19 events per year ($\pm$0.092).
No such effect was found in males in either study.
%%%

A study by \citet{Hussin2011} examined in recombination in 195 maternal meioses from French-Canadian pedigrees.
Here, the opposite effect was seen, with recombination rate found to decrease with maternal age, with a larger effect size, estimating a decrease somewhere between $-$0.49 and $-$0.42 events each year.
Differences in the direction of the effect here may be due to real differences between populations, when considering the French-Canadian as a genetic isolate, or simply due due to a lack of power with only 195 meioses.
%%%
Another study reported a slight decrease in crossover count with maternal age in 338 meioses, finding a decrease of $-$0.29 events per year\cite{Bleazard2013}.

While evidence for an age effect on crossover count in females is conflicting, these studies all agree that there is no age effect present in males.
A recent meta-analysis by \citet{Martin2015} provided much need insight into the age effect issue.
Using a combination of nine cohorts comprising $>$6000 meioses, the authors report a modest but significant increase in the crossover count with age.
The authors used a comprehensive and systematic approach that avoids the methodological differences between previous studies.
%%%
An interesting suggestion from this study, was that of possible confounding factors upon the maternal age effect.
One, that assisted reproductive technologies, including IVF, may provide an artificial selection for oocytes with a greater number of crossovers.
Second was the possibility that oral contraception, which suppresses ovulation, could somehow alter the age-count association, especially if the production-line hypothesis holds true for humans.
However, neither of these possibilities could be controlled for with the power of this study and remain undetermined.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Hotspots}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Initial discovery}

Sperm typing produced the first set of well-characterized hotspots in humans, initially focusing within the MHC\cite{Jeffreys2000,Jeffreys2001}.
The correlation of hotspot locations identified by sperm typing in this regions with breakdown of LD measurements provided support for the use of LD methods to find hotspots of recombination genome-wide, without the expense and limitations of single-cell assays\cite{Jeffreys2001}.
In 2005, \citet{Myers2005} produced a fine-scale recombination map in the human genome using LD methods.
Along with this map, hotspots were found to be a ubiquitous feature of the human genome, with a set of $\sim$25,000 found, occurring roughly every 50 kb.
Hapmap LD study expand characterized hotspots throughout the human genome.
These LD studies of recombination also estimated the proportion of recombination occurring within various fractions of the total genome sequence, finding that recombination was intensely concentrated, with 80\% of all recombination occupying less than 20\% of sequence.

Extensive analysis by sperm typing has indicated that hotspots are generally 1-2 kb in width\cite{Jeffreys2004a,Arnheim2003}.


\subsubsection{Discovery of PRDM9}

Since hotspots were first looked at in detail, and the discovery that they were common and spread across the entire genome, questions regarding a possibly regulatory mechanism for hotspots have persisted.
\citet{Myers2005} found that hotspots shared many common features including repeat elements THE1A/B, and a common sequence motif (CCTCCCT) located at the centers of many hotspots.
A further famly of motifs were identified via the use of the Hapmap phase 2 LD map\cite{hapmap2007}, encompassed by the degenerate 13 bp motif (CCNCCNTNNCCNC)\cite{Myers2008}, estimated to be involved in up to 40\% of all hotspots.

Spencer2006 : hotspots associated with increased GC content, and GC increasing mutations, a likely result of the action of biased gene conversion.


In 2010, a series of papers by three separate groups converged on the identification of PRDM9 from different approaches.
This protein, originally called \textit{Meisetz} was discovered in mice, and is active in early meiotic prophase\cite{Hayashi2005}.
PRDM9 contains a high polymorphic zinc finger DNA binding array, as well as a methyltransferase domain, responsible for the trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4).

\citet{Myers2010} compared the sequence of the 13 bp motif against predicted binding of various zinc finger arrays in the genome, finding PRDM9 as a top candidate.
%predicted binding sequence of the PRDM9 zinc-finger array in humans, they found that PRDM9 is a match for the 13 bp sequence motif found at the center of human hotspots.

Using a mouse genetic approach, \citet{Baudat2010} focused on a locus previously determined to be involved in localization of crossover initiation\cite{Grey2009,Parvanov2009},
and narrowed this genomic interval to a region containing the \textit{Prdm9} gene.
A third study used fine mapping techniques in mice to narrow the region, again identifying PRDM9 as the likely candidate protein\cite{Parvanov2010}.



\subsubsection{Hotspots in other species}

Hotspots have been discovered in a number of other species.

Mice contain approximately 15,000-20,000 hotspots, also under the regulation of PRDM9
Mice: Brick2012 (Hotspots via ChIP); Smagulova2011. 15-20,000 total

PRDM9 absent / present

Dogs (Axelsson, Auton2013)

Yeast

Birds


\subsubsection{Conservation between species}
Humans and chimpanzees have a complete absence of hotspot sharing, despite a high degree of overall DNA sequence identity\cite{Ptak2005,Winckler2005,Auton2012a}.

Discuss hotspot paradox vs stable hotspots theory (latter saying hotspots are confined to specific chromosome features (promoters/GC content), as in yeast and dogs)
\subsubsection{Species lacking PRDM9}
Dogs, birds (Singhal2015, biorxiv)

% Hypothesis / goal of this thesis.
\begin{titemize}
    \item To investigate specific properties of recombination and how it differs between sexes, individuals, populations, and species.
        %\item To examine how the absence of PRDM9 has affected the recombination landscape in dogs.
    \item To examine how crossover interference varies between individuals and across species.
    \item To further investigate possibilities to model gene conversion in the human genome.
